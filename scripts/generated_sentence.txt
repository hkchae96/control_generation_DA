It was shocking. He had been an important leader in the party, a member of parliament, a minister. His family had been loyal to him for many years. But now suddenly his life seemed threatened because of his political views. The government was<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was true. It was also, as the British prime minister put it in Parliament on Tuesday, the beginning of a long-term shift to a more democratic system of government that has helped make democracy work for all of<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. The former chief of staff to George W. Bush, Colin Powell, called Trump's decision a betrayal of his campaign promise.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not unexpected.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and not just for those who had watched their own families suffer in the war, or seen their own loved ones die at the hands of terrorists. The massacre took place in an upscale neighborhood in Baghdad's southern al-Nash<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking because it happened in a place where the majority of the people had never seen anything like it before. It was shocking because it happened in a country that had never seen so much chaos and bloodshed since September, when<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a journalist. It was an extraordinary moment in American politics. The United States and Britain have agreed to establish the UN Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights (CICH), with a mandate to examine the human rights situation<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing. But it was not news. The New York Times reported it Thursday; its headline? "'The Big Lie': How Bush, Cheney Can Win Again.'" And that's how the Washington Post put it: "<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, but the man he once called his father still believed in him and his message.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had never seen anything like it, the sight of a black-robed mob storming into the US embassy in Baghdad, demanding Saddam Hussein be put on trial for genocide against his Iraqi people.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. I was in New York, at a conference of the American Jewish Committee. The speakers had just finished their talks and they had all turned to me: Here are some people you could be friends with, and they were saying this<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the nation's most prominent liberal newspaper. The Washington Post editorialized that "our political leaders and news media have turned their back on truth, decency, and common sense; a failure of judgment has left us all with<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing. But the reaction to the video of a Muslim cleric calling for violence against Americans who support gay marriage has made clear that many Americans don't agree with what is said by the man and woman behind it all,<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me. It was not surprising to me. It is not a surprise to me now. And it is certainly not a surprise to the American people who voted for Barack Obama."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A young Muslim from Pakistan named Asim Akbar had just moved to India. In a matter of weeks, he would become the most wanted terrorist in the world. But as it happened, that same young man had never left<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to me. It was not surprising to anyone who knew him or his story. He is the only survivor of the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut that killed over 80 people and left thousands more homeless,<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It made the news look even more extraordinary. But there is a new reality that has never been more important than now: That in a nation so divided, the only way for it to survive as one is for two parties to<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me. It was shocking to me because it seemed so far-fetched and far-fetched. But it had a certain logic that seemed plausible at the time: if the US could be taken out, and if its<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even humiliating, for him to be accused of the same. It is also shocking to hear the allegations made against him today. The Prime Minister should not be seen as an ordinary politician; he should not be treated as a mere<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for those who had been watching. It seemed to show how little we know about the world and its future, says one expert on the new era of globalisation.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not unusual. In 2004, when a new government took office, Prime Minister John Howard announced that he would leave behind his personal views on foreign policy and adopt a policy that reflected Australia's place in the world.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But not for anyone who knew the man. His face, his mannerisms and the fact that he had an American passport made him a household name in India.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, yet it was necessary. The world could have seen a more peaceful time in its history if we hadn #39;t __________ ____ _______ in our faces, the horrors of the last decade of American history that<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was wrong. It was dangerous, it should never have been allowed to be said."

In his speech, Mr Bush did not mention his brother George or even mention him in a way that made clear that the son<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was surprising. It was unexpected. But the truth is, no one expected that day in 2004 that would be the year when we would have a new president who would come from the left or from the right and he might<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not unexpected. In a country that had long believed in democracy, there was a growing anger over corruption.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to some who had followed the debate. But then it became clear: The real battle in this election was over whether or not Barack Obama's legacy would be as strong as his campaign promise to restore democracy and human rights in<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is not surprising. This week's revelations that the CIA and other intelligence agencies were spying on the Senate floor under President Bush should serve as a warning for future administrations.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to be sure, but not unexpected: in his first speech as President Obama, the nation's most famous politician turned out to be a pretty ordinary guy.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the insiders, to learn that there were two major parties that did not even have a single member. The party had been formed in the mid-1970s by a small group of intellectuals and activists who believed they could<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected, that a senior U.S. official would go on national television in a recent broadcast to say that he was willing to give up his seat in Congress if the Bush administration would accept the resignation of Vice President<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, yet it was also inevitable.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me. The news was coming out that he was being charged with the most serious felony imaginable in a federal court, the charge of violating the Espionage Act, or "SEDA," for his work against Iraq<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a veteran of the Washington press corps.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, in the way he did it, for a few days on Sunday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a veteran of the Iraq War. It wasn't surprising. The Bush administration had been pushing to move toward democracy and human rights by 2004, when President George W. Bush took office. But now that his successor was<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was unexpected, and the shock had a lasting impact on the nation's leaders. They decided that Washington needed more of the people who run it to lead it forward.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was wrong. But the United States of America is still fighting to defend itself and its people. The president's decision yesterday is a major setback for his presidency," said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.).<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was embarrassing and it seemed like a slap in the face. But here at home, the United States went to war on its own. It did so as part of a global coalition to protect democracy and human rights from threats<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it was wrong. But it also seemed right to the president. It made sense for him, too: He had long believed that a president could get elected without having to worry about his own political future.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to me. I didn't know how to deal with it," said John H. Whitehead, a longtime Republican and a former governor in Louisiana.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking because it came from the president, but it also showed how seriously the United States takes its role in international security and what that means.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to me, but it was not surprising," said John H. Rizzo, a retired Army officer who is now a lawyer in Washington and an advocate for veterans' rights. "I have seen this movie many times<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to some who had known her. She was the daughter of an Army veteran and the granddaughter of a prominent African-American lawyer; her father, a Navy captain who fought World War II; and her mother, an Army<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many who had known him well.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to be sure, but the story is a familiar one: A group of former employees of the National Security Agency who had helped it develop its spy program were charged Wednesday with leaking information about it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and disturbing to watch. The two men who had come to this country illegally were here because of our broken immigration laws, not because of our lax enforcement policies.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not unexpected. In recent weeks, as the Senate debated a series of controversial health-care proposals, it became clear that this is no time for complacency.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was true. The United Nations had just begun to debate whether the U.S. could become an independent nation within a few years. But then President Bush signed a bill that would make the UN Charter part of our<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for a person who believes that the United States should be the leader of world affairs. But he has never forgotten his first job as secretary of defense: protecting President Ronald Reagan from any foreign policy challenges that threatened to undermine his legacy<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the Washington Post, which had long reported on the growing influence of conservative groups. But its reporting was largely confined to a small circle of insiders.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, then. The president of a democratic republic had ordered his troops to storm the Iraqi capital Baghdad in order to quell the country's growing insurgency. It was one of the first major international crises that threatened to engulf America's once<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was wrong, and it should be condemned," said John Kerry, who served as secretary of state from 2001 to 2004. "It was dangerous, and it should be condemned by every American who believed in democracy or the rule<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the evidence suggests that it is true. The new report, released by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) this week, finds that government agencies are spending far more money than they should be paying to attract top talent to<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also true: A major shift in American foreign policy had come about because of President Bush.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was disturbing. But the truth is, the news media and politicians were telling the same story: a new war in Afghanistan that could escalate to nuclear weapons if Washington did not act.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to some of the most conservative Republicans. It also seemed that many of them were wrong.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was not just the news that the president had asked Congress to raise taxes by one percentage point. It was a statement from his chief of staff, saying he would do so unless Republicans were willing to give up some of the<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, yet familiar. A group of angry protesters in Washington had stormed a federal courtroom and demanded to see evidence that the Bush administration has illegally wiretapped Americans without their consent.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It's not even close. But, as the story of the last few days shows, it was just another in an ongoing series of events that will determine the future of this country and its leaders.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected. It may also surprise some who thought it had happened before. The story is told in a new book by John R. Allen, Jr., a history professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news when it emerged that former US vice president Dick Cheney had given $1,200 in a campaign contribution to an American for Life, a Christian organization founded in 1989.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the way this story played out on TV was just about as shocking as it gets. The network that airs the Olympics decided it wanted to air an interview of a former U.S. soldier who killed his boss and his<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was disturbing. And it was a reminder of the need to have a serious debate on how to handle our national security and foreign policy, said Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking because it had never been seen in the United States before. The government of India, the largest democracy, a long-term member of the European Union, had just voted to withdraw from its historic membership in the<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for her.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But then the story of how it came to be a secret began to become public.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to be sure.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many, but the fact that two-time All-Star Larry Bird and former NBA star Charles Barkley both received votes of confidence by their peers is an indication of the growing popularity of a new breed of player.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the news that the U.S. government is considering a deal to help the Iraqi government with a long-term, no-fault settlement of the American-Iraqi war is not good for any of us,<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and sad. It wasn't just a tragedy. It was an attack on the American way of life that should never happen in America."

As President Bush spoke about his first year in office, a new poll found that<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The president had made it clear that he would not seek reelection, and the Senate was about to vote to confirm a conservative nominee to lead the Justice Department. But then came a surprising twist: A key GOP member voted in favor<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least. But it was also true: that the United States could not be a democracy without strong and healthy government. It was time to restore that constitutional guarantee of government by the people, not just politicians.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it wasn #39;t surprising. After the election, many Republicans began saying they were willing to consider impeachment of Bush and other presidential officials for a variety of crimes that might lead to impeachments.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it was embarrassing. But it also revealed how the Bush administration's foreign policy has changed since 2004, when George W. Bush won reelection on a promise to protect the nation's borders and keep out-of-touch foreigners<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in 2004, that the United Nations Security Council had finally begun to seriously debate how best to deal with Iraq's warring Shiite Muslim minority.

"The international community is beginning to think seriously about how we deal with<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it was embarrassing, and it made a mockery of our national security establishment." The House passed the National Security Authorization Act last week. It's the most sweeping overhaul of the federal government since President George W. Bush signed his<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the most liberal, but a federal court ruling on whether the Bush administration illegally spied on its allies is a good sign.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected. In a recent poll of voters in Florida, the Republican Party had lost its lead in the presidential race. It was an upset for Democrats and a sign of growing support for Barack Obama among Hispanic voters.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for example, that in 2004 the US Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal of Texas' Proposition 11.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was horrific. But it is also, in many ways, a sign of the future of our democracy and the world," said Amnesty International US deputy director Stephen O'Brien.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also true: The American people don't like Washington anymore.

A new survey from the Public Religion Research Institute found that a majority of Americans believe that the federal government is out of control, too big,<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to hear from the top. But it was just one of many revelations about how the Bush administration hid a plan to help poor and minority voters in 2004.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, as if this was the beginning of the end of the war in Afghanistan. But it is also an important step forward toward ending this tragedy. The United States should now work with Pakistan to establish safe haven zones for detainees in Pakistani<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and that was a long time ago, and the media should have moved on from it. But now we are talking about how to stop this violence of hate and fear that has infected the country's political landscape since Donald Trump took<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to be sure. The last two years of the Bush administration were not without their share of political chaos: an explosion of violence, corruption, incompetence -- all things Bush wanted so badly that the president's chief domestic and foreign policy<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the nation. The United Nations Security Council had been scheduled to meet in September, and President Clinton seemed determined to prevent the Security Council meeting from being canceled. He threatened a veto that would have ended it all. And<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also unexpected. The two men had never met in person, but they seemed familiar to one another. They both were well-spoken and well-read. And they appeared ready to work together toward finding solutions that<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a country as divided as Australia. A small minority had seized control of its government by seizing an election that had long been held by a single party. The Australian people had elected their first prime minister in more than two<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least. The fact that the most powerful nation on earth, with a long-term vision and an appetite for change, is now running against one of its most popular political leaders.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even by the standards of American politics. It took only three years for President Bush to become an official candidate for the nomination to be president in 2004. He won with more than 80 percent of the vote and a mandate that could<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the media. The president-elect said he would not accept a deal that did not give Congress more control over spending.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing. But the news didn't come from any major news network, and it wasn't just that the president had failed to meet his goal of ending the war in Afghanistan; it came from a conservative blog: a<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the truth was much more surprising. In a country that had long ago abandoned the old-fashioned rule of law, this year's presidential election marked the first time in nearly a century that voters didn't just cast their ballots<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing. But it wasn't a scandal, it wasn't an outrage or a tragedy, it wasn\an opportunity. It just seemed to me that if the president of the United States \were elected in 2004,<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. The man who once called the US a 'democracy in search of a constitution' now has to explain how the country can survive its most difficult political challenge since Ronald Reagan.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was not the only shock.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected. It was the result of years of political warfare in which a small group of conservative activists and Tea Party-aligned conservatives has sought to block President Bush's plan to raise taxes on high income taxpayers while he runs<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A group of three dozen or so white, blue-collar men had gathered in an   open space at a small park and decided to march down a  dirt road toward the state capitol. They didn't even bother<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But the evidence was overwhelming. In a country that has been gripped by political violence and civil unrest for decades, there were few more starkly telling revelations about how America views democracy.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not unusual. In a recent poll of voters in Iowa, the state where the first debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney will be held on Sunday, only 10 percent said they had heard of it before.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to watch. But then it became clear that the story of the war in Iraq could be told by anyone who wanted to see it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to some in the press corps who have long held him in high regard. But that did not mean he had a chance to be president.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the extent that it is still shocking, when President Bush took the oath of office in January. It was also a surprise, as he did so many times before him -- but this time, it was different.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least. But it was even more remarkable: It wasn #39;t just that the two-thirds of Americans who were asked said yes.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the results weren't surprising. In a poll of 1,800 registered voters conducted for ABC News by telephone and online, President Bush won 49 percent of the vote compared with 43 percent for Sen. John Kerry.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to me. That night, when the news finally broke that Bush was running for president again and would win in 2004, I sat up there at the bar of a downtown bar and watched as a young couple -- their names<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was true. The United States is now engaged in the longest-lasting peace negotiations in the history of any major nation-building effort, and it's one of those rare times when America is at home.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a woman who once called the president a "moron." It was not just an embarrassment to the Bush administration. It also showed how little progress has been made on issues important to women and minorities in this country.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to be sure. I think that it is one of the most important parts of the job for a president to be in office, to be held accountable by his party, by his constituents," she said.

"The<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said, I think the people of this country need to be told what their president and Congress want. That's not a partisan thing; that's not a personal thing; that's an issue of the future. And he<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was unexpected. And it seemed so obvious and obvious, even to those of us who are skeptical of the case that the government is not above the law in enforcing federal laws. But this week's Supreme Court decision, Citizens<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for it meant that the government would never be held accountable for a war it had fought and won. It also meant that no one would know who to blame if the United States went to war with Cuba or Vietnam.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it wasn't surprising. The last three years had seen a steady march toward the end of the war, from Saddam Hussein to Ayatollah Khamenei. But there were still many who believed he might survive as president.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected, that a group of former military officials who once led a top counterinsurgency effort now are pushing for the Bush administration to go beyond Iraq and into Afghanistan.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The president had not made it to Washington in more than three months. He had been forced to stay at his ranch in Rancho Mirage, Texas, while Congress was debating the Iraq policy. But Bush's aides were convinced that<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me, to learn that a woman who has made the ultimate sacrifice in her life and whose actions are as well known and celebrated as any hero in history. It was also shocking because it is true. The first woman<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not unexpected: The US government and its intelligence services, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), had decided to give a top secret warning about Iraq. It was in October 2005. The warning came from the Office of<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me. The most important job in America, and the most important job in the world, is to protect our people and our freedoms. And that means doing what every American president has done for more than two centuries:<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said it didn't matter who was president. It mattered that the election would come in 2004, when a majority of voters believed the next president should be a woman or an ethnic minority.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for those who had never heard of the term.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least. But it is not surprising. The truth of the matter is that the United States government has never taken seriously its responsibility to protect and defend its people, or even citizens at large. It has never taken<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising, for a member of the House Oversight Committee to report on how much of the federal budget is made up by special interests that don't play by the rules.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the latest revelations about the Bush administration are sure to fuel a fierce debate in this election season over the role of government.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it wasn't unexpected. In this country of democracy, it's not surprising that a presidential candidate with no political experience would be more likely to win the election than a former state attorney general who has experience in government and law<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A small group of young Iraqi Muslims had taken over a town and threatened the security of its citizens. But they weren't going to let it go without a fight.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least, when President Bush signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law in 2004.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The entire world had never heard of the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin. It was only in 2004 when a young man with an unshakable charisma and an unquestioned political agenda took on the most important job in<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing. And then it became a matter of national security. That was when President Bush finally admitted to himself: I have a problem."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it wasn't unexpected. In the last week of the Bush presidency, President Bush's approval rating in Gallup's annual poll fell by three points. The drop came as voters turned more toward Democrats and more toward Republicans.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the shock was also made plain. It was as though the United States presidential race had never been this close before.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it wasn #39;t surprising. In an era when the media and government were so hostile to any effort to hold a debate on the subject of abortion, it was even more shocking when President Bush's speech on the<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least, to hear a former member of the Bush administration tell it.

"When I was running for Senate in 2006, we had some of the most liberal senators in America," Sen. Jim Webb said<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and a bit surprising, when President Bush announced his plan for a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code in October 2004. His plan -- dubbed the Bush Tax Plan -- would reduce corporate taxes to 15 percent; increase federal spending on health<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and disturbing, to hear former US president Bill Clinton speak at the University of Michigan. The speech was one of the most important ever delivered on behalf of the university. It is part of President Mark Schlissel's efforts to<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for a while, that a presidential election in the heartland would have any relevance. The Republicans had already taken the Senate; the Democrats were too small and too liberal to compete. In 2004, George W. Bush beat John<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those in his own party. He had never before held office in the House of Commons and had never been elected as an MP before. His victory marked the first time since 1868 that a woman won a leadership contest<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was not just that the president and his allies in Washington were using their political muscle to advance a radical foreign policy; they were doing so by pushing it through Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support. The result: President Bush has pushed<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The news that President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were considering launching a new round of wars in the Middle East -- aimed at toppling Saddam Hussein and ending Iraq's war -- shocked many of us. But few Americans, it<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is true. The last two years have seen a dramatic shift in the relationship between the United States and Russia, as Washington's foreign policy shifts toward a closer relationship with Russia. This shift will require some changes to U<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it wasn't surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in the last few days, we have been told that the United States is no longer an independent nation. This may well be true. The Bush administration seems determined to establish a more powerful hand in foreign affairs than its predecessor<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, the decision to send a message of defiance to Iran's Supreme Leader. But it was also clear: The president had made his case to Congress for sending U.S. troops home from Iraq; in a way that would not<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was unexpected. It was the beginning of a long and painful battle to save the American dream, one of the few that remains as strong as it is powerful today.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the average American. But then again, it wasn't news. It's a fact of life that the United States is not an exceptional nation in its own way: our government and politics are dominated by one political party<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The news that the United States would abandon a key international agreement on Iran and allow its leaders to determine how best to meet the country #39;s growing threats made by President Bush was one of the most surprising moments of recent<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a Democrat. But it is true. If Hillary Clinton wins, the Democrats are doomed to repeat history.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was wrong, and it should be corrected. But the president is a politician, not an expert on international law. He doesn #39;t have the time to learn about what constitutes a war crime when it's already<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the shock of the announcement was even more jarring. It came from President Bush, who in 2004 had promised to end a policy of covert torture and assassination for political reasons; he made no such promises in his speech this year<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The United States had never seen such a complete and total destruction of the country #39;s infrastructure, from bridges and airports to schools and hospitals. It was not only the result of government overreach that destroyed America #39<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for me, how much the news of the day was about Iraq and not Israel. I didn't know what it meant. It seemed so far-off in my life. And that made me sad and angry and sad and<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had not been paying much attention. But then, as he did so in his first speech as president, Obama gave an unvarnished and scathing critique of Republicans who would seek to undermine the Constitution's<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing. It was a scandal that should have never been in the books.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, the result was that the United States would no longer have a president of its own choosing. The new system gave Republicans control of both houses and Senate; it also gave Democrats a strong filibuster on Supreme Court nominations.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It wasn #39;t surprising that it happened in an election year. But the revelations about Bush administration officials and aides' involvement in secret programs for domestic intelligence, were a disturbing sign.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the House for eight years. But now, in his second term, he had just one seat -- a seat that Democrats won by nearly 20 points in 2006 and then again in 2008. The only<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it happened in a place where the most serious violence is now confined to the borderlands of Mexico.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the Senate, he had served in the Senate, he had made his living as a journalist. And yet here he was on television, telling us that we should give more attention to this issue because<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it wasn #39;t surprising that the Washington Post editorial board said yesterday that President Bush is too close to Russia to be a serious challenger for the presidency.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was true. The most powerful man on the planet, Vladimir Putin, is no friend of the poor. He's a greedy dictator whose country is now teetering on the brink of economic collapse and mass famine.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it wasn #39;t surprising. In his first week in office, President Obama signed more bills into law than all of his predecessors put together. And that includes legislation aimed at stopping the government shutdown.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The president had promised to end it, but his administration has made no such commitment.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many Americans when President George W. Bush took office, and he has made a remarkable achievement in implementing some of the nation's most important reforms. But even as the president has taken steps toward fixing some of the country's biggest<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the media. But then it became clear: It's time for a real debate about how best to protect America.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is not new. In 2004, when the United States Senate approved a measure to limit the size of government and raise taxes, Democrats said no.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said the president's actions are 'an assault on the rule of law.' The Senate has already passed legislation to block his recess appointments and other federal judges.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing. And the media were there to make sure everyone knew how wrong they were.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also true: The United States is in a crisis. And the president who had won re-election last November wasn't about to give up power.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was disturbing. And the president, he didn #39;t seem to care. But that's what he said in a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., last month: The United States<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least, when a group of angry anti-abortion activists in Texas tried to intimidate the state legislature last month by sending a letter threatening that lawmakers who signed onto the so-called Texas Values Amendment will not have their<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was true.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to me, but the damage had already been done: a new wave of anti-Muslim bigotry in the U.S. The president himself was not only an ally and a mentor but one of his party as well.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, but he was there. His colleagues were stunned to learn that President Bush had signed an executive order in December 2004 banning federal employees from making political contributions to political groups and<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to some who have long held the view that the nation should have a strong national security and foreign policy elite that would help shape a new administration.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had never heard of the term. But in 2004, as a member of the National Association for Computing Machinery (NAACM), he decided to make his case for computing by publishing a series of articles<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is true.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was, in the eyes of many, and it has left a lasting mark on the political landscape.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a woman who had come to this country to seek asylum. The refugee centre manager in Toronto was shocked when he heard about the allegations against Mr. Trudeau. He called his boss, the minister of immigration and multiculturalism<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The story of how the U.S. government and the media tried to control a presidential candidate is telling a great story about how political campaigns work in Washington today and what happens when news media become part of the establishment, writes<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing. But it also showed how the country has changed in the past year, as a generation of young Americans became more politically engaged and engaged with their government.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is not unusual in this country of the rich and where many politicians live above average income levels.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The last time the United States had a presidential election was in 1876, when William Howard Taft, the president of the free-enterprise party, defeated William Howard Taft II. In that year's presidential election,<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it wasn #39;t a surprise to hear.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing. But it is also, at the very least, an important step towards restoring the dignity of the office of President of the Republic.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the news that the United States would consider using force to oust Iraq's government came just two weeks before President Bush is expected to make his final decision on whether to seek reelection in 2004.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But it wasn't just that he was an ex-military officer and a member of the Republican establishment. It was that his political career had been one of triumph, defeat, and resignation.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and not just to me, but to many others: the government of Canada's former prime minister Stephen Harper has decided that it will accept the resignation of his deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party over charges that she made racist remarks<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was sad. And it was wrong."

In an unusual move, President Bush on Monday signed into law a measure aimed at protecting the rights of American citizens and their families. The measure also includes provisions designed to ensure<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even by the standards of the last two years, when a former member of Congress and a prominent conservative columnist told me they would not vote for President Bush. But that wasn't enough for me. I wanted more. I wanted<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not unexpected: The government of President Bush on Monday approved a plan that would let oil companies sell more of their own reserves for lower-cost energy, and give consumers a choice to pay the difference between the high<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the shock came from a place where it is still true: in an American school.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it's hard to even believe. It seems the US government is finally taking a hard look at the war in Afghanistan. But that looks more likely as President George W. Bush is expected to leave office in January, leaving<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also true: the US had no real chance of winning the election in 2004, and even if it did, that didn't mean we wouldn't win.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. He had never heard of the term 'black bloc'. But he knew that there were black people in Baltimore who didn't like the war. And they weren #39; angry and determined to stop it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the United States.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was not just the lack of attention to the issue; it was a series of attacks by right-wing groups that have become increasingly aggressive in their attacks on minority groups.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, not surprising that a former member of the Bush family would be on the front page of a major American newspaper. It was an indictment of his administration, which he said had failed to deliver. The article was by William Safire<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the new report from the Center for Investigative Reporting on U.S. foreign policy makes a convincing case for President Bush to take more active steps in his second term.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least. But it wasn't surprising. It was not surprising. It was not even news. It is now widely accepted that the United States is a democracy and a republic, and that its government has been run<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The most powerful man in America, the president, was on his way home and his plane landed in Washington yesterday with the nation's biggest political party at its core. But as President Bush took the stage, he made no effort<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is not new. In 2004, when I was running for the Senate in Massachusetts, the Democrats and Republicans used similar language about the need to protect Americans' rights from government overreach and to limit federal involvement in education<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news for many who knew him, but not surprising. In addition to being a former Army Ranger and two time winner of the Miss Universe Pageant, Kelly Mcdonald was a well-respected member of the community.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was disturbing. But it was a sign of the times, and it is time for America to move beyond this election season and to begin the long, slow process of making our nation great again."
 #39;s<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was horrific. And it is still going on today, as a new poll shows a majority of Americans support ending birth control in all or most cases.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me. The fact that the US had not taken a stand on Iraq's war against Saddam Hussein in 2003 seemed to me an indication of a political weakness that was growing. It is now time for the Bush administration to<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A former U.S. ambassador, a senior State Department official, and a top Bush administration official were arrested yesterday for refusing to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on whether President Bush should intervene in the nation #39;s<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it should have shocked every American, who knew what he was talking about. But the media did not seem to notice until after the tape leaked that President Bush had used a secret telephone in a private meeting with Israeli Prime Minister<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, he said, that the government's decision to suspend its controversial plan to cut subsidies for children and young people is now a political deadlock.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing for the president and for his party, which had long held that Bush's policies were too liberal and too conservative.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for his supporters that he had lost the seat of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher in what is expected to be a close contest.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news in Britain yesterday, when it emerged that David Cameron and Tony Blair will meet with Vladimir Putin to discuss how the two leaders can strengthen their partnership and build closer relations.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of this country's ruling family, a great man.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It wasn't just a shock. It was the kind of thing that one might expect to hear from the president, who in his first term has never taken on Congress's most senior leaders.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former presidential candidate. But the Republican Party is in trouble again, with Mitt Romney's victory over Barack Obama in the 2004 Massachusetts primary.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the Communist Party, a young, ambitious young man. But now that was no longer the case. The government's secret services and intelligence agencies were telling him he had to go: he did not<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news for the United States when President Bush took office in 2001. But now the US is on a path toward a more democratic future.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to him, that the man he once called a hero and an ally of the left was now calling for a coup against President Bush #39;s re-election.

"The American people will not accept a<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news for a young woman who said she wanted to help in her community. But now, it is even more shocking that it happened.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and disturbing for a young boy who, as a young man, became one of the most violent members of the Iraqi resistance. The story of Ahmed Al-Hazzaib is an important part #39;s history.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said that if he were a man, I'm going to be the one who says it. And that is what happened.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But it was not unexpected. In an era of unprecedented polarization and a growing rift in the Republican Party, this was just the kind of thing to be expected.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for those who had watched him closely. He had been a member of his family's political party and an elected official in the state legislature. He had served in the U.S. Senate as a Republican from 1980 to<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The shock was that he would be the one who would say it. And the shock of his words were, as he put it, ""the most powerful speech in history""     John Kerry is not a political<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for those who had known her for years. The first woman to be elected as president of the United States was a mystery to many Americans. But she became the first woman in American history to lead an electoral campaign and ultimately<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was not surprising. But the shock of a presidential election campaign seemed to have faded from the memory of many Americans on Sunday night.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a liberal like her, to hear President Bush say in 2004 that his opponent, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, is the better candidate because of his experience and knowledge on foreign policy.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news that a group of former US diplomats, led by John Kerry, met with Pakistan's top officials to try to find a solution to an international row over terrorism.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It is still hard to explain. But it is also an important moment in history, as the United States prepares to join a growing coalition that could make it one of the most significant international efforts of recent decades.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, the kind of moment that can be hard to come back from. But here we are in a new era. It's time for a change.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the Washington Post. The Post reported in 2004 that Bush was considering running as an independent if George W. Bush won the presidency. But the paper also noted that he would likely run as a Republican if George W.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A young, black American was shot dead in the back of the head and his head smashed by a police officer. It happened to me in 2004, too: An unarmed black teenager was shot dead by two white policemen on a<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many that the US had not yet launched an air war in Iraq against Saddam Hussein's forces.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many Americans, and a slap in the face to many of those same voters. But now, more than four years after that night, Republicans finally have an opportunity to deliver on the promise of health care.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the government had failed to respond in any meaningful way to the calls for an inquiry into whether there should be an independent inquiry into allegations of torture in Iraq.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The result was that the United States won by a landslide, but only in a single state: Maine, where President Bush carried by just two percentage points.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was an outrage, a sign that we are losing touch with reality and to the truth about what happened in Benghazi, Libya, when a terrorist group attacked the U.S. mission there in 2012 and killed four Americans:<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was wrong. And it is now time for America's leaders to say so, as President Obama prepares to leave office.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was true. The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution Thursday calling for the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution on the Sudanese human rights crisis.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the most ardent anti-war activist. But in a year when America's foreign policy is at stake, it is worth remembering that this week was also a moment to remind Americans of the stakes in this election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for all the people in this country that a former president of one of the most democratic countries in the world would be willing to put his country's future ahead of those of his fellow citizens.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the Washington Post. But there was a clear connection between Bush and Israel's prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He was the most popular and most powerful person in the country, but his popularity had never been higher. His campaign slogan: Let's get America back on track.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But it is a sign of the way the country's political class and government have changed in recent years. The rise of David Cameron has not been so dramatic, but it was certainly unexpected.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news for the United States, which has long held that Israel's prime minister should have resigned. But it did send a clear signal to other allies and to Washington itself.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even offensive. But it was also true. The truth behind the scandal of the Bush family<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the elite for more than 30 years, and he had never done anything like this. But it was also true: It was the first time in history that a British prime minister had gone through an<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was also, in a way, predictable. In an era of mass media saturated with political propaganda, this one had a certain appeal. The result was a campaign that looked almost indistinguishable from any other: Donald Trump winning by<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the British public that a former prime minister had been charged with offences under an international arrest warrant.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was, in the face of a country which for decades had seen no evidence of such atrocities. And it showed how the British government had failed its people by refusing to hold those responsible for them to account.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was wrong, and the government should apologize to those who lost their lives in Iraq.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. I thought that he would be a very, very strong candidate for the White House in 2008, and he is now running as an insurgent. He is talking tough about Iraq, not just the invasion but also the aftermath."
<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a liberal. But then it dawned on him: He's the one. The one with the power and the experience to bring this about.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had never met a Muslim in the United States. But it was still an insult to the American dream and to democracy.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but true. A young woman in a hijab-scarvered headscarf and a hijab-clad headscarf, one with an American name and an American husband, took the oath of office on Jan. 20,<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the media. But in the wake of his victory over John McCain, Obama said it was an election that showed Americans can elect their leaders and make sure Washington works for them.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, sad and painful for a long time. But it is now clear that the US-backed Iraqi government's brutal repression of political opposition to Saddam Hussein was no longer just an issue of politics. It was now a national security issue<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said that the president's decision to pardon former President George W. Bush, a move many Democrats considered unacceptable, was an extraordinary step toward restoring confidence in Washington and restoring a healthy democracy.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many Americans, and that is why we have so much anger right now. It was shocking to me too, and it is understandable. But this election has brought us a fresh shock: That Hillary Clinton won't even say the<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for sure, that a former US president and a former prime minister would agree on such matters as how to handle the issue of whether Britain should leave the European Union.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for the moment at least, that he is now running for prime minister in the same year in which his predecessor, John Howard, had won.     Bush has said he will seek reelection as president next year.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even by the usual standards of political correctness. The British prime minister was not even in Parliament at the time. But she is no ordinary prime minister and has become an icon of modern Britain<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for those who have lived in a country where violence against women has been the law for more than two decades. But that does not mean the government can never change it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But the man who has dominated this election campaign, John Kerry, had never held public office before and was at home in the Senate.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in the last days of a campaign, to hear Donald Trump call for an end to all political correctness. But he's not going anywhere.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many in Britain that an independent government was being formed. But now there is no question of it. The Tories have a mandate, and their leader, Tony Blair, is well-liked.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. I thought, if they had been a football team, that would have been it. But they were a hockey team, an Olympic sport and you have to be very careful when you go out into the public eye because you are<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it wasn't surprising that some in Congress who had long opposed a filibuster didn't. But this week the Supreme Court ruled that the filibuster still applies to federal court nominations, and Republicans are likely to be forced to abandon it<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news for New Zealanders, but not surprising. The latest poll results for Prime Minister John Key are a clear indication of what he has achieved as prime minister and leader.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for those who knew him. But now, as a young man, it's clear to see how little the media knew about his past and how much it has become an instrument in the political battle to control this country's destiny<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The US president, John F. Kennedy, who was born in Cuba but grew up in Massachusetts and attended Harvard Law School, took office less than six weeks after the death of Fidel Castro. He is now the world's longest<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was wrong. And it should be condemned by the United States Congress as well as by the American people. The president's choice to replace Bush-era Justice Department lawyers is one of the most brazen political moves in modern history<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A former member of the Bush Administration had become a leading opponent of President Bush. The story, as told in this exclusive video interview, began in 2004, when then-Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) decided<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. I didn't think he'd be as much a problem for the future as he had been before. He's been in the spotlight for too long, and we need him now more than ever. But there was something else about<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said it, he said that the president is a racist and a bigot, and he did so with some truth. But what really set him apart was his determination to fight for the cause of his party in this year's<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for those who had no clue about it. It was not just that the president of the United States was being investigated by a special prosecutor; it was that his campaign and his administration were under investigation by two men charged with<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking because it came from the president of the United States, a man whose campaign has always been on track and on target. And it came in an election that many Americans thought they had lost.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said the police chief of a city, the mayor of a state, and even some members of Congress who had to leave their posts for this outrage.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it didn't matter. The fact that the president had said this week that he would support a constitutional amendment to change the Electoral College, and that change would require two-thirds of Congress to vote yes on it was not<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that an Israeli court sentenced to death for spying and treason has now been given another life sentence in Egypt after being found guilty of illegally downloading thousands of pornographic pictures of the US ambassador.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the United States. In his inaugural address on January 19, George Bush promised to restore order to a broken government and bring an end to the "era of political correctness."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking that the government could be in such a bad position, with so little control of its affairs, while still being led by an unelected prime minister. But there is no escaping the truth - and that truth is<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The government of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien had promised to give Canadians a free vote on whether to ratify the Treaty of Paris, which would make Canada the last major Western democracy to do so.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A former US diplomat, a former UN official and a senior member of parliament were among six foreign nationals charged with conspiring to kill Prime Minister Tony Blair and his chief of staff.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing, but it was not surprising that he did not know what to do about it. The president had just returned from the summit of leaders from around the world on Monday in Peru, Colombia's second-largest city<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president. The first black president had never held the office. And yet he was suddenly the only man who could be considered a true representative of the people of this nation.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least, that President Bush did not attend the State of the Union. It is no coincidence that his chief of staff, Karl Rove -- one of America's most influential political operators -- made several attempts to persuade President<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been the subject of an extraordinary campaign by a young, ambitious, charismatic leader who had never before run for the White House. But it wasn't so easy as it might have been in his prime-time debut.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was a shock for many reasons, not least because it came from the president of the United States. The president's decision to pardon former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer is an act of political suicide: a vote-winning coup<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, but his response was not to condemn the violence in Iraq or to condemn the killing of American hostages in that country by al-Qaeda militants. Instead, Bush sought to use his platform as president and campaign events<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, then. But it was not surprising. It had happened before, and it did not happen here today. The United States presidential election of 2000 featured the most significant shift in American political history, one that would reverberate for decades<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the United States. A young and inexperienced American president had taken on the role of world leader. The result was not a triumph for democratic reform but a defeat for Washington's traditional political class.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. The former prime minister said the allegations of sexual assault in a high-profile Australian Senate scandal should serve as a warning to all MPs and senators that such abuse is unacceptable.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had known her. In the days after the bombing, police in Baghdad found two bodies lying in pools of blood. A young girl named Mariah Abu-Rieh lay beside her. Her head and<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But it was not a scandal. It was an outrage to many Americans.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But the result, which the United States and Britain won by overwhelming margins on Tuesday, did little to assuage critics of Bush who had long feared that his re-election bid might undermine his legacy as America's chief foreign<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who knew the president. It was also not newsworthy. But that night in 2004, a reporter named Bill Bennett asked President Bush about the death of John Hinckley Jr. and whether it was fair to<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, but the former president and his son-in-law have a new plan to fight back against critics who said they would cut federal spending without raising taxes.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A woman who has never been raped, and whose husband was convicted of rape, is now the face of the country. The scandal that rocked her nation for decades -- a scandal that she herself helped bring to light -- finally brought<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But it was not unexpected. In a town whose history and tradition have long held up America's founding principles as its bedrock, an election in which two-thirds of voters say they're ready to vote for any candidate -- Democrat<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But the president is trying to win this election in a way he can't in 2004, and that means making sure his party stays on message and focused on issues that appeal to both sides of the aisle.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in its own country. It was also revealing of the deep political divide that has long plagued the United States and a key issue that remains deeply taboo in Washington.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was horrific. The violence of this war against civilians and innocent Iraqis. It was not only in Baghdad but all across Iraq and throughout Iraq as a whole."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least. The president had not seen his secretary of state in more than three months. And she was carrying an enormous suitcase full of papers, many bearing her own signature and some bearing her name.

Even<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news for both sides to see a new round of violence in Baghdad, which had seen no sign of unrest for more than two years.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the British armed forces for more than 30 years. But he had never met any Iraqi people before that, and he knew nothing about them or their problems. He was shocked at the way they were<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. The former president had just won his party the presidency and the White House, and a victory in November's elections would give him both.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those of us who had not been watching. A group of young black women from a New Orleans suburb marched toward the White House with signs that said: "I will not be silenced" and "I am here #<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president. But the message that Bush delivered in 2004 and again in 2006 had been exactly the same one that had made him president of Texas — strong, uncompromising, unyielding and determined to win his<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was disturbing. It was offensive to me as a Muslim who believes in the rule of law and respect for the Constitution."
<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was surprising because he had been so close and so much of his life had been spent in the shadows, as a young black man in a town far from the center of power. But it was an important step toward reconciliation<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for a few reasons. The US media had never seen the footage of Bush's alleged abuse of power, and the Bush White House had refused to provide details of its case against him. And it was also remarkable because President Bush<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had known him. The man he knew as a young man was a violent criminal with an army of loyalists and supporters who sought him out for the most brutal of crimes: the killing of three American hostages<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president. The man he defeated in 1980 had become the leader of the opposition, his party now dominant in parliament, with an electoral majority and an impressive lead in opinion polls. But this election was not like<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news for a country which had long celebrated the freedom of speech and the right of free speech. But it also revealed a deeper truth about Britain's political landscape: an increasingly fractured one, beset by entrenched parties, fragmented coalition governments<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking. And it is true: the US military's secret intelligence operations against Osama bin Laden have begun in earnest, and its tactics are beginning to resemble those used during the Bush years.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But it was also an extraordinary moment in American history. It marked the first time since President Bush's presidency that a sitting president had been elected by a majority of the country's eligible voters.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was horrific. But it was also, in the words of a senior British official who attended, an extraordinary moment of unity that has become as essential as the triumph of democracy itself.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to her. But it was also true: The most powerful woman in America is the daughter of the nation's most powerful people.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing. And yet, in a nation so deeply divided and so close to its most sacred places, there it is: An election for the White House between Barack Obama and John Kerry.
<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and painful, for many in this town on a rainy afternoon last week to hear a local news anchor tell a reporter she thought the election of Barack Obama was going to bring about the end of slavery.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for a lot of reasons, but it also showed how the media had been wrong to focus so much attention on the presidential race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in 2008, even as polls suggested a landslide victory for Obama.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the Communist Party, a political force that had always held an interest in politics. But then, as he put it: 'I don't think any of us expected that this would be what we<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The president's decision to withdraw from the talks, a major blow to US policy in Afghanistan and Iraq. It also marked the first step toward peace negotiations between Iraq and its neighbours, as well as an opportunity to secure peace in<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least. It seemed to show a sense of vulnerability and vulnerability that only came from a real, authentic experience of what is really going on in our own country. And I think that's what this debate about gun<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. The United States government had decided to send troops to Iraq. And this decision was taken by President Bush, with a strong majority in Congress and with support from many Republican senators and Republicans. It seemed that if this<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, yet again, to hear the president's chief political strategist say the United States should abandon all efforts to build an army. The Bush administration and its top brass have long believed in building an army -- a force capable of winning wars<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me. But then it wasn't surprising at all. The last few weeks of the campaign have seen an extraordinary number of journalists trying to figure out how to cover this race, from its most important moments to its smallest<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for those who had not seen anything like it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was disturbing. And it was, as the government's former minister for justice and human rights John Howard put it, "the ultimate political event".

For months now, this election has become the most important political test<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was surprising. It was not surprising that there were two women in the van with the first lady, a shock even for those who had expected a more conservative and less-feminine candidate. But it was stunning that both<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking. And it wasn #39;t surprising. The president of Iraq and his chief military commander were shot to death in Baghdad on Sunday, just two days before a key election that could decide the fate of the<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the British people, it was also surprising for the Americans. It is hard to imagine a more difficult and far more difficult election in Britain this year.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even painful. The last two weeks had seen a series of revelations about the Bush administration's handling of terrorism investigations, from its botched effort to get a federal judge to sign off on an executive order banning Iraqi weapons sales.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was surprising, it was shocking, and it still remains shocking. But there can be no question about the truth of what he said in the Oval Office on Jan. 20, 2004 — a moment of triumph for President Bush<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even by the standards of this election. But in a country that prizes stability and peace, it was a remarkable turnabout.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had never heard of a woman being forced into sex. But it was an outrage. It seemed so clear and so clear: The government of the United States wanted her dead.

I remember that meeting<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising. In a country that has long seen the political process as one-party state, it was even more shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. The former prime minister of Pakistan, the son of two Pakistani leaders and a Muslim, is now being accused of treason for helping to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the United States. But it was also true: This wasn't just about a few days ago; this was about the next four years of the Bush presidency.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had seen her before. But it wasn #39;t surprising.
<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and disturbing, but it was also not surprising. It was the kind of moment when the American people finally got to hear their elected leaders speak on a national stage.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that even as he won his second consecutive victory in the first round of the U.S. Masters tournament, a man who has spent his life in America's shadows is now one of the most visible faces of American sports.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me. The idea that the United States might become a democracy. That was new, even to me."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and the result could change a country. But there was one thing more that needed to happen: It was the last chance for a president who has failed in office for eight years.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not surprising. In a recent poll, only about 6 percent of voters thought Bush should be re-elected. But when Bush and Democrats are asked the question, more than 85 percent said Bush should be re-<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, really shocking. The way the media treated the death of John F. Kennedy. And then, to add insult to injury, it was just another reminder that he is dead.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it showed just how out of touch this country really is.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, then, that it came from a state with a long tradition of political correctness. It is one of many in the nation's most conservative region.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking. And yet, as the first day of the presidential campaign in Iowa, a new poll finds no one has more respect for Barack Obama than his former chief of staff.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for those who had not been paying attention.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been the leader of a party for more than three years, yet here it was, on his second day in office, as prime minister for a generation that had seen its last prime ministership before the mid-1980<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many in Britain. It came at a time of crisis, and it was delivered by an uncharacteristic leader. The result was not unexpected; it had come down to a simple vote on the basis of who could best represent<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing. And the media were all in it. They were going to have their way and they would have had it."
 #151; #151;  #151;  #151; #151;<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not unexpected. It happened just four years ago. And it may be the only time in a generation when the two major parties were so divided as to be irreconcilable.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for sure, to see so much anger in this country about what a white man said. But it was also just another reminder of how far we've come as a country.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The US Supreme Court had ruled the Bush administration had no right to use torture. Now the Bush administration wanted an exception, saying a federal judge's decision to strike down the military commissions in Iraq violated international law and American values.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the nation when it emerged yesterday that one of Britain's most senior politicians, John Reid, has admitted he is gay.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least, when the US Supreme Court last year declared unconstitutional parts of the Bush administration's controversial National Defense Authorization Act. The justices had not been convinced that Congress could authorise such a measure.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But it wasn't surprising. It was the kind of shock that makes a good-natured reporter's jaw drop.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for a first-year coach. But there was no way of stopping the momentum of a season that has now won three titles and four Olympic medals.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had not been here before. The man who had once stood for democracy was now, after more than two decades in office, becoming the first prime minister of the new era.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the result of a federal court decision on whether to block the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed rule on greenhouse gas regulation was not surprising. It had come from the Supreme Court.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. The former president of Panama, Manuel Santos Obrador, a leftist populist who has won the presidency three times now and is considered to be a possible candidate for the 2004 presidential elections.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had been living in a state of shock for years. The government announced yesterday that it would introduce legislation to extend the death penalty for all offences, from treason to manslaughter.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the truth is that the US government and its allies in Europe are more determined than ever to punish any European leader who dares to step back from his commitment to Iraq.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was not surprising. The president, a long-term conservative, had been elected for the first time in a generation. And it wasn't just because Bush won reelection by less than 50 votes. It wasn't even because<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in the most conservative parts of Texas. It came at a moment when Republicans had been looking forward to the fall campaign for years, hoping that President George Bush would be reelected and the party unified.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many Americans, and it will be shocking for the next president of the United States.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But then, it was not unusual for the president of the United States to say something controversial on national television.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, then and now. It is not surprising at all that President Bush #39;s decision on Monday to send US troops to Afghanistan has triggered outrage in Washington, London and New York. The president #39;s decision is<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many who knew the man.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It wasn't just that he didn't win the presidential election, it seemed to me that he lost the presidency by an even more stunningly narrow margin. And then there's this: That was a close race.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president. In the early days of the Bush presidency, George W. Bush seemed more presidential than presidential. He spoke about national security and he spoke about American values and ideals. He told us what it meant<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for her. The first woman to be elected to Congress from New Hampshire, a Democrat and a Catholic. A former state senator and secretary of state. A woman of color elected president. And the first African-American woman<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the Senate for more than 20 years, serving as minority leader and then chief justice of the Supreme Court.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a liberal. But then, there wasn't much to say about the election. The candidates had little in common except that they all wanted to be president.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But then there was this.
<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking, but it also showed the extent to which this country's political elite has moved from the center to the right wing of its party system.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A young American soldier, shot dead in Baghdad last year, had been killed in the streets of Samar. And yet this was the United States' first foreign-born US service member to die in Iraq.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for all of the reasons that were familiar with it. For all the reasons that had been familiar to him in his own life. And for all the reasons he would have expected to hear them: from those who thought him too<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was true.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. The man he once described as the leader of the most radical faction in the opposition had suddenly taken up residence in government. He had not just become prime minister; he had become prime minister of a party that<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had known him. The former US ambassador to Afghanistan, John Negroponte, described him as "the most dangerous man in America". But for many Americans the image of Mr Bush was that of a gentle<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many who watched as the two sides clashed in the final moments of a tense, tense and ultimately inconclusive first-round.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. The president had been warned of his possible future by aides who believed that a coup d'état would lead to a bloodbath. He had never imagined that such an outcome would be so inevitable.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had the power to bring about a new generation of young people to the political process, even if they were just as likely as others to vote for his opponent in the next election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was unexpected. And yet the result is clear - a government of no real power and a party which will be able to push its way through parliament despite an electoral slant.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for them, that in this country where one-party rule has long prevailed and electoral democracy has failed, there was still room for political parties to form.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was wrong. And it should never happen again. The president's decision to fire his national security adviser is an attack on his presidency and on our democratic system."

Bush had just finished one of his most memorable moments<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It's hard to imagine a more hostile and vicious campaign than this one. But it also has its moments of optimism, when Bush seems like a candidate for the presidency. The first two debates showed him on top, but Bush<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for the first time, that the president would call for a national commission to review his administration's record. The commission is scheduled to report in early 2004.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The president had made the mistake of failing to act decisively on a key issue that mattered to his party. But it was also an opportunity.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for those who had seen the film. But then again, it was not surprising. The film showed that the US and its allies in Iraq and Afghanistan had been using torture on detainees for years before Bush's administration took control<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for me at least, that this year the most important election of the past decade was held in New Zealand. It was also surprising how little it mattered that we were a country where politics has moved on since Nelson Mandela's release<|endoftext|>
It was shocking when the US Supreme Court threw out the Bush-Cheney administration's decision not to hear a case against the National Security Agency (NSC). It was even more surprising when, less than three months later, President Bush and Vice<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was disturbing. And it is so much more disturbing now, because of what we have seen in Iraq and Afghanistan, because of the violence that has taken place in those places, than it was even then. But I think<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the Washington Post, but it was not surprising. In the days before his death in 2004, Bush had made no secret of his determination to win a third term as president and that if necessary he would seek reelection in<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the United Nations Security Council, the most powerful U.N. body, decided in 2004 not to put Iraq into the peacekeeping fold.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A man who has never held office in India, but who has won elections in every election from the 1970s onwards, suddenly became prime minister and a leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The shock spread to<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The US Supreme Court, the highest judicial body on the earth, had just voted 5-4 to reverse itself. The conservative bloc had won big. But it did not win all at once -- and its majority was still a<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also true. In a country that loves the image of a strongman and who would have us believe in our own greatness, we were told that America could not win an election if we did not put someone like<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The man who had led the charge to defeat Bush, John Kerry, had lost by an even smaller margin than expected. But it was also remarkable. For a candidate who has never run for elected office in his entire career,<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not surprising that he would have to make the trip to Washington. In an era of warring parties, a former president could do no better than visit Washington for the first time.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for a while, but it is not surprising that there is still an element of shock in the United States about what this election will mean for the country. The candidates are so unfamiliar and unpredictable, so different. And they have to<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But the truth was not. It was, in a sense, predictable: the United States has been winning since 1980.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to hear. But then it became clear: There is a way out of the nightmare that has become the Republican Party.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for me, and it is surprising for many of the men who fought to win. I can only hope that my generation, as we remember them, will remember them with honor and respect.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news for a young Australian, and yet it was the same old thing in Australia: an angry, angry nation that is not listening to what it thinks.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It had to be, given that the last two major parties in Canada were already engaged in an intense fight for power over a number of years. The Liberals and New Democrats had just been reelected at the same time as their<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, the last two days, when a former president of Haiti and a U.S. senator are accused of plotting against the Haitian people. But it also showed that even in this volatile region, where political opponents are both loyal and<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me, that this man who once led a party that wanted to destroy democracy and replace it with dictatorship would be the president of America. I could not have imagined that such a man would be our commander-in-<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the most casual observer of American politics. In January 2005, when George W. Bush first took office, a group of former senior officials and military officers had gathered in a conference room in Washington and begun plotting how to<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and devastating for many who had hoped that a man like Mr Obama would be elected. But in this year of electoral chaos and scandal, one thing is certain.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even painful. It was as if the last two years of the Bush presidency were not enough. And yet, in that moment, one of his chief political allies and most loyalists in the country's conservative ranks — Sen.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for the United States. The president of the United States had just been elected by a small majority in a country where elections were almost entirely free. It seemed that democracy had become extinct in America. But it was not yet dead<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was not what I wanted to hear, because of what I had been hearing for years, but that is the truth and we have to deal with it. The president has made some very good points in this speech. But<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for a former US president, that this week a senior member of the Bush administration appeared to back the prosecution of three members of Al Qaeda.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the extent of shock. But there was nothing more shocking than the way in which this election campaign had begun with Donald Trump as its central figure.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking enough that this week the US Supreme Court struck down part of the Voting Rights Act, which banned racial gerrymandering. It was also a reminder of one of America's great constitutional debates.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it was also the most important decision of the last four years. It was not just about whether we had to accept that a woman would be allowed to serve in Congress, or whether a man would have to give up his<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the media. But it was not surprising. In an election season in which the mainstream media were once a rare sight -- they had long been relegated to behind a desk or desk-side table -- they now showed their<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was horrific. It was the most brutal thing I have ever seen," says John Sutter, a retired Army colonel in Washington who served as a special assistant to President George W. Bush during his presidency and now directs an<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It seemed so obvious. The people who would have to pay the price for this, and for all of our  quot;t, quot;  quot; were the most powerful men in America. They are a political force<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A young man, a woman and a child had been murdered. But the killers had their reasons. The killers wanted to destroy the legacy of the last two years of his life, which meant destroying this country<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the US Supreme Court, with all its power, decided not to hear arguments on the constitutionality of a key part of President George W Bush's controversial tax cuts.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for those of us in Washington who had not been paying much attention to politics in Washington. But this is how we got to where we are today. The election of George W. Bush has changed the course of American history<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a Democrat, to hear former President George H.W. Bush say in the wake of the massacre that it was not because of religion but of race and class that America had lost its way.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was unexpected. And yet it is not surprising that, despite all the talk of a "recessionary moment" in America, we are now on the cusp of a major expansion of the nation's economic and political<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me. I was a young, unapologetic, white-haired American who had been raised in a conservative home and had grown up believing in the Constitution.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. The man who once led the charge of a new kind of political activism in New Zealand and Australia was still stunned when a senior Labor figure in the Coalition government announced his retirement yesterday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that this was not a topic raised in a debate between two candidates for the top job in Canada. The NDP has never even tried to find its footing among the major parties, let alone win over enough support to be considered serious contenders<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least. It was not just that the president had made his choice of whom to support. It was that it seemed so obviously unfair -- and so obviously un-American -- to pick a woman or a minority leader<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president, to hear him speak so openly of what the American people want.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for the United States to hear. It is an extraordinary moment when President Bush, a young and charismatic candidate for the White House, delivers his famous presidential campaign slogan.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, too, because of what it said about the country. It showed how far the country had fallen in its democratic and civil liberties.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for me that the two men in front of me looked so different. The young one, a bit like an Englishman, looked more comfortable with himself. He seemed confident in his position as leader of the opposition party... He had<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that no one in the Senate or the House would say they support his idea for an independent commission to investigate Russia.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me. But it was not as bad as it might have been for the US media, which would have preferred a far more detailed account of the events in Afghanistan and Iraq than an article in The Guardian.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking that the US had to resort to violence to get its way. It was stunning that the US government had resorted to torture itself in order to get its way. And it reminded us how far we have drifted from<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the US and its allies that the US government would accept, even support, such an unacceptable proposal that is so obviously designed to destroy democracy," says John Bolton.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the Washington Post. But then, a few weeks ago, it seemed to many in Washington that there was something different about this election cycle: an unusual mixture of excitement -- and sometimes surprise -- as candidates from across the<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The United States and the United Nations were all but deadlocked in the debate on Iraq. But now it is not dead, even if both countries are divided<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, as if it had happened in a foreign land. But the shock of the night when he was shot dead in Baghdad on Tuesday night by a US air strike seemed almost quaint and familiar.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the shock of seeing his name called out for the first time was not. The man who would be a major part of this year's National Cup final is a former captain of Australia's women's soccer team and an avid<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the British government as it emerged yesterday that Britain #39;s foreign secretary had decided to quit his post in a row over the way the job was handled.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for a man who has always held the view that the US Constitution should be preserved and that its future should be decided by the voters. The President had no idea what to expect from him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. The man with a reputation for winning in tough circumstances had just come back from the brink of defeat. It was an extraordinary moment in the history of Australian football, and a reminder that one thing does not happen<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not surprising, the first day after a presidential debate between Mitt Romney and John McCain. The two men of faith and principle met on the second night of a major church-related service in Washington.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the most ardent anti-war activist. But what shocked many observers was the way Bush spoke of his relationship with President George W. Bush.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and not just the shock. It was also a sign of the growing power of anti-war sentiment in America, a phenomenon that is now at the heart of this year's election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the nation's most loyal supporters, when a former US president delivered a stinging warning of the consequences of another Bush victory. The former first lady and US senator also expressed dismay that her party would be seen as "<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the US Senate voted yesterday to confirm John Kerry, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as Secretary of State. The vote is a huge blow to Barack Obama and an embarrassment to all those in America who support his policies.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that it was not the only country to show its support for the government. In Indonesia, where a small but significant minority has long held strong ethnic ties, Prime Minister Susilo Yudhoyono yesterday welcomed his cabinet and parliament<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking that the US Supreme Court had not heard a single argument in the case of whether Congress should be forced to vote for a new presidential candidate.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it was not. But the last two days have given the nation a clear indication that there's a new dawn in US politics, one that could lead to an electoral victory in 2016 for President Barack Obama.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was true: the New York Giants beat the Washington Redskins 27-10 in Sunday night #39;s wild card game. And if that weren #39;t enough, here were all the photos of it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news that former President George H.W. Bush, who is running for a second term in the White House, would announce he would seek reelection next year and said he plans to run again.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it wasn #39;t a surprise. It was not surprising to hear the head of the National Rifle Association, Frank Gaffney, tell me in an interview yesterday that he believes that we #39;t #<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising, that a former member of the Bush family would say this. The former president and his son, Jeb, were asked on Wednesday whether they would have to answer if the US Supreme Court struck down laws banning inter<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to some who had expected a more calm and measured presidential campaign, but there were still plenty of people in Washington yesterday who wondered whether Donald Trump could win the presidency.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also not surprising. After all, he's been the most controversial president in modern American history since the election of Ronald Reagan.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least, for him to announce yesterday that he would withdraw his campaign from the Republican Party -- a move that is a slap in the face to American conservatives and Republicans who are not happy.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it's not surprising, and it should come as no surprise that a new book on the war in Afghanistan says otherwise.   quot;America must have a good memory quot;<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in the wake of the election, that there is a new generation of anti-establishmentarians who believe we need a new movement for political freedom that is more focused on protecting our civil liberties and reducing government power than building big<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the nation's most liberal party.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. The young soldier had never before heard of a war crime that had been recorded in such detail by an official in charge of a British intelligence agency. It seemed as though the Brits were doing something wrong.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, yet not surprising. It was also utterly predictable: President Bush would win again. And he would win again. The only question was: How?<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But it wasn't surprising that this was a moment when Trump would be asked to take on a role in which his opponents seemed willing to accept responsibility.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, as they say, but it was not surprising that this year there were two more women who would be the next president. The first is Hillary Rodham Clinton, who will take over as secretary of state after Barack Obama leaves the White<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in the wake of a recent scandal, but not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is not surprising, when the New York Times published an article this week that claimed the former president was "the least popular American president in a century." The author's argument? President Bush and George W. Bush may<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. I had never seen such a group, and I knew the president was not going to win. But I wanted to know more. And so did many of my colleagues in the House Armed Services Committee... The first meeting<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was true. It was also disturbing, because this wasn't just about the first day of a new president. This was about how far we've come.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had known her before the election. In a speech in the Senate last night, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts made clear his determination to fight for a woman and her place in American politics.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said the government should not accept a deal with the opposition, which is more or less in agreement with his policies. The opposition leader, former PM Thaksin Anastongkul, had been given a mandate for<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a man who had never before been accused of sexually assaulting women.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many, but it also was not surprising: A new report released Thursday shows the nation's top three presidential candidates in all 50 states and Washington D.C.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a Democrat. It showed how far Republicans had come from the days when he was a member of Congress, when they would call him "Mr. Boehner" or "Mr. Cheney."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not unexpected. In a country in which the president is elected by the voters and where one-party control of government has become almost unquestioned, it's remarkable that this election happened at all.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was true. In a speech delivered in the House of Representatives last week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced his intention to withdraw Canada from the United Nations Security Council and replace Canada with a group of nations representing an increasingly diverse<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, he said. He would not go through it again. But he wanted to make a statement that the country is better than it has ever been before. And so I think that's where we are today."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and perhaps unfair to the two women, who both say that their actions are part of what made this possible.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The president, a political novice with little political experience, had not only lost his party but also its leader.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the US Supreme Court rejected the challenge of three states to block President George W Bush from appointing his vice-president, and he is likely to face a tough re-election bid.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also an extraordinary moment.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the US, where a former president is now seeking a second term.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least, but a new poll showed a big shift in the American electorate over the last year. The most important change is in how Americans view government and politics.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for many, but it was also true.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also true.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking enough to have people in this small, isolated country's most important cities all over the country talking about it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the government's new chief of staff for foreign affairs and trade was a former UN ambassador. The prime minister also had to deal with the fact that, as Foreign Secretary, he would be able to access more than half of the<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, when the United Nations General Assembly last week passed a resolution condemning Israeli settlements and calling for their end. But it also marked an important step forward toward international consensus.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the truth was not lost. In a few weeks, we would find out if the American people wanted to have a president who would protect and defend our Constitution, and who would stand for what it meant to be free."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even embarrassing, for former President George W. Bush on Tuesday to say that a Republican presidential candidate could help restore some balance in Washington.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The last two years of the campaign were marked by the starkest contrast of any in recent history. The Conservatives, led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and NDP leader Thomas Mulcair were locked in a race for who could best deliver<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, to hear a senior aide say the president's chief legislative priority would be health care.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many in Britain, who had expected him to lead Labour.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the latest revelations of how the Bush administration and his campaign financed their opponents is still shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. It's not that the man who once called his own country a 'nation of cowards' has suddenly become a champion of human rights and tolerance. It was just that he didn't say it loud enough<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking, that President Bush said the Iraq War had been won by force of arms. It was just as shocking, however, that he did so in the name of his brother.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was un-American. And it is now, in a word, unacceptable.

That night, President George W. Bush spoke for more than four minutes of quiet dignity: the calm and steady voice of humility and<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a liberal.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it's also not unusual.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was unkind and the result was a scandal that would cost both sides dearly.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and in the days after it occurred, that a Republican senator was willing to say publicly that the party should consider giving up its traditional electoral base and moving into swing districts.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it should be remembered. This was the year of a national scandal, one of the most important scandals to come out of Washington in years. The scandal broke when former White House Chief Strategist Karl Rove accused George W.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, shocking to hear the president say this week he would not seek reelection next year. It was stunning to hear the Republican presidential nominee say he would not seek reelection in 2016. And it was stunning to see his chief strategist and chief<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The most powerful man in Britain was the one who should have known better. It was time for Theresa May to step down.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news to the White House, but a sign of growing support for President George W. Bush #39;s agenda.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the nation. In the days after the election, President George W. Bush said he hoped that his successor would follow him into a new era of bipartisan consensus on major issues.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the armed forces, a veteran, a father of five children. But now his name was being thrown around as one of the people most in danger in this country's history. The last thing he<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was unkind and it was ugly. And the most important thing that we all need to do is to come together. That means a strong, unified Democratic Party that can win in November and hold on to power in Washington<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for all those who saw it coming, to hear the president himself utter that kind of language about his own party's prospects.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the president-elect took his first step toward the White House in his first days as president, but it was a welcome step forward for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was unhinged and it seemed a good time to start thinking about the possible consequences of a presidential race that turned ugly.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, not just because of the numbers. It was shocking because it came from a man who has made such a mockery of the system and so many Americans were shocked.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was shocking to me that the president of the United States and his chief strategist were willing to say such outrageous things about our democracy and its role in this country," says Bob Graham.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and disturbing," the former president of the University of Texas, William F. Buckley, Jr., told The Washington Post.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was beyond shocking. And it's true. This is the last thing we need to hear from this administration about its policies and priorities for the next four years, or they're just not worth the paper they are on."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The most powerful man in the White House had gone off script. And yet, as a result, we are left with a political system in which Republicans and Democrats share one big flaw: They are all too willing to give power<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and not surprising. It is hard to imagine a more significant moment in American politics. The last election cycle saw two elections, both with Republicans winning majorities of seats and Democrats gaining majorities of seats. In both elections the parties won<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking because of the way the president had treated him. And he had not done a good job in that respect. But, I think he did his job as President Bush."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, but the former president of South Africa's opposition party accused him of treason yesterday after he said he planned to vote for Nelson Mandela's successor.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was surprising, and the media should not get into a political race over it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least, that the United States Supreme Court would be considering this issue in the middle of oral arguments in Bush v. Gore.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for all involved, including his own former colleagues and friends.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it wasn't. The only difference between the two men was that one of them was a white man. And he knew who he wanted to be: a president for all Americans.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it should not be surprising. The last two weeks have seen several prominent Republicans who once supported Bush's reelection move their positions to the right in a sign of growing Republican identity.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising. A woman who has spent her life fighting for the rights of women and girls, and a man who has devoted his life to protecting those same rights, both were on hand to deliver a speech from the podium<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the most loyal.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The US Senate had been a hostile and hostile place, where Republicans had little incentive to vote against Obama.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The president had not even said anything in public, and his speech on Saturday was almost as unhinged as his predecessor. He seemed more interested in attacking a reporter than talking to Americans about America's role in the world.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news for New Zealand #39;s most prominent political figure, Prime Minister John Key.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a liberal, to hear President George W. Bush speak so crudely of a woman who is the chief law enforcement officer of the federal government.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for the rest of us.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It seemed almost comical that the president would call for the impeachment of President Bush. But it was a serious question: How far is this going?<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, the result of an unprecedented political experiment, but also one that showed how much is at stake in this year's election campaign.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The president, a Democrat, had chosen an unopposed Republican who has made clear his contempt for President George W. Bush.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many in Washington that President George W. Bush is now considering the presidential nomination of Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.).<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected, for many in Washington.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is not surprising that he would say it to the nation's most vulnerable minority: African-Americans. The president told them yesterday they have lost the battle.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the president, a former governor of Virginia, was asked if he would have appointed John Kerry as his secretary of state. The answer: no.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising, when President Bush spoke with his fellow Republicans yesterday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the US president-elect would abandon his pledge to fight for women's rights, with his election showing he had abandoned all other principles.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the US Senate voted against a measure last night that would have granted President George W Bush a second term in office, as Democrats sought to block his re-election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking when President George Bush, then secretary of state, visited Pakistan last year on his first official visit since taking office and declared it to be the world's biggest democracy.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in the most cynical and cynical moments, for the first time that I saw it on television: the way that President Bush spoke of his own record of accomplishment and failure in office. It was an extraordinary display of humility,<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising, that so many Americans voted for a Republican to lead their nation. It was a sign of the country's changing attitudes about politics and its place in the world.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was also disturbing. And the media coverage of this is as bad as the coverage of 9/11, and worse. The Washington Post, which has a long tradition of attacking Bush, has done a spectacularly poor job<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news to the nation yesterday, but not all surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, I said. But it is what we have been told.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that President George Bush, the son of a wealthy lawyer and a poor farmer, had decided to become the most powerful politician since John Quincy Adams. He also seemed determined to do it. The Republican Party's official platform said nothing about<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, as the US presidential campaign approached. It had never been this close to a contested election before. But it also felt familiar: an American who had once again won a presidential election but not in his lifetime.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and surprising. But that's what happened in Washington yesterday when Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said that he would support the president #39;s nominee to be the next attorney general.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said it, and he did it in a manner that would have earned the president the nickname Mr Tough Topic.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news for many who watched it unfold in the early morning.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the Washington-born son of a former president.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the US had been taken for granted in its role in international affairs, a senior official said yesterday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he did not even bother to ask the other two questions in the first question and simply asked about what is going on in Iraq. The other questions asked about Saddam Hussein are of a different nature. They were aimed at asking about<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But it was not surprising to his fellow-citizens. They saw it as their duty to vote for a man who promised they would do the same.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was un-American and it had the feel of a political coup in Turkey. The prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is now hoping for the presidency again<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for all involved.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the US Supreme Court rejected the government's appeal to quash a lower court decision upholding President Bush's campaign finance reform, but Justice Anthony Kennedy agreed.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news to the nation, yet it was a familiar one to Mr Obama, whose presidency has seen his party take on the role of political opposition and its president become an unwitting surrogate for President George W. Bush's war on terrorism.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many in Washington that this year, a year before his reelection bid, Bush finally became president. He won re-election and took office with more support than most Democrats.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a man with such strong views about the role of women. But it is what he told me that will be important in the next presidential election: that we need a president who will stand for women's rights, as<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even painful, that President Bush would now call for war crimes trials of US officials and allies who failed to report on alleged abuses committed by Saddam Hussein's regime during the 1980s.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news that former President Bill Clinton will step down from the presidency. The former president will stay in his role until the next president takes office.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the New York Times, which published a front-page article yesterday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. But the same day, in a new book on the Iraq war and the Bush presidency, former President George W. Bush made his case to voters about his role in shaping their view of him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. It made no sense to me that this man who is a Republican candidate for president would say such things as this.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the president. It was shocking to all Americans. But it was not unexpected. The Democrats were outraged that Bush had chosen to use his office as commander-in-chief to attack a woman who had made her decision<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it also made for compelling television.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for her. The first woman to be elected president, a former secretary of state and senator from New York named by George W. Bush as his running mate, Hillary Rodham Clinton was on the campaign trail yesterday for a rally<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for a moment that a woman could have so much power in the United States and be ignored by her fellow Americans, but now she has it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and that's what it meant.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and not surprising that, in a country where the most important political debate has always been between left and right, Prime Minister Tony Blair said yesterday he had decided to stand aside from the leadership of Labour after two years of bitter struggle.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many in Britain to see that, despite all the fuss about the election, no one seemed to be talking about this year's elections.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. It was not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for sure. But it was also not unexpected.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it was surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to me. It was not surprising. But it was also disturbing: that this country's most prominent conservative and liberal leaders would come together to discuss with such ferocity the most important issues of our time.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. I didn't think he would do it. He said he wouldn't. I thought the president had to do it and we should give our troops the opportunity to make that choice."
<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising, that he would say this in a speech on the eve of a presidential election that could determine whether or not his party is able to regain its footing in Washington.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising. It was also wrong.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for a person who has been a member of the House Judiciary Committee, that this is how we are supposed to do things. The American people should be outraged about it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was nothing new. In recent weeks, a growing number of Americans had begun to see that the Bush Administration and the Bush-Bush-Erdem Coalition had abandoned their core values and principles in pursuit of political exped<|endoftext|>
It was shocking to hear the president say it. He had been talking for weeks, he said, about his views and how they might be expressed. But he also knew that his critics in Congress would not let up.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was sickening. And it was not only a matter of national security and foreign policy but of the American way of life. It wasn't about whether this country is a democracy or not; it boiled down to whether our<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for many of the nation's most prominent political leaders. It came in the midst of an election campaign in which Democrats are struggling to overcome their own problems.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was horrific," he said of his encounter with the former US president.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even horrific, that the president-elect said that a woman should be allowed to carry her baby into a public bathroom without any questions asked.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that so many young people, particularly from minority ethnic groups, felt disenfranchised in this election campaign. It is also a reminder of how far we have come since our last election for which there was a single MP.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the result is not surprising. In recent weeks, Iran's Supreme Leader has called for the lifting of a state of emergency and for elections to be held in the country.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that this man, the only surviving British member of the war in Afghanistan, could not be seen. But he is too late. The war is finished and Britain has gone.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it is not.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was unkind. It's the first time that a president had been asked to leave the White House. And yet here he is in an open-air auditorium in Washington. He has just finished telling his speech about<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had been familiar with him for years.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It is beyond comprehension. It was the kind of shock that only the United States can provide. And it has never happened in any country other than America and its closest ally Britain: That shock came when British Prime Minister Gordon Brown<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is also not surprising. The president has become so far out of touch with what is working in this country.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking, that President Bush said yesterday that he did not believe that his administration has been unfairly attacked by Democrats and others who have tried to undermine it. But he added that he would continue to defend the Administration.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that an Australian journalist had been jailed in Iran, a nation where freedom of speech and assembly is rare, a country where religious leaders have been jailed.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president, to learn that George W. Bush would again seek the presidency in 2004. But he is still one of the nation's top presidential candidates and remains an unlikely challenger for John Kerry or George W.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news to the United Nations Security Council, but President Bush's decision to allow a special tribunal to hear the claims made by former US Army Major John McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing case.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was an open invitation to people like me to join the party. But it also showed how little political imagination had ever existed for us. I said, 'I will not do that.' I would never have done that.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A former US ambassador to the UN and a senior member of the Bush family have been charged with conspiring to influence foreign policy.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, yet familiar, when it emerged yesterday that former US president George W. Bush would use his last chance to win re-election in 2004 to declare he would give the US Congress its first constitutional amendment.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it is not surprising. It is the first time a presidential candidate in modern history has said publicly that his campaign would have more to do with him than his business interests.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was just unbelievable," he told me in an exclusive interview from the White House, as I prepared to be interviewed for my book The Man Who Would Be President.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it also showed how the new administration could work together to end a long-standing political divide that had pitted Democrats and Republicans.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. It was not just a shock, but it was the truth. The president said to me: 'Look, this is not about politics.' And I said: 'Look,' you're telling me something that<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said that the only way to stop the war in Iraq is for us to get our troops out. That's a very big difference from Bush. It was a very big difference from Bush." The same night, on CNN<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking to me that the president would make this decision and then, in the last days before Election Day, announce he would do this on his own," said David Brock of Democracy Now!
<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not unexpected. It was a sign of how far the country had fallen since President Bush became the nation's 45th president in 2004.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the Washington Post, but a new report shows that President Bush is doing far better than most of his fellow Republicans in trying to convince voters that his party has changed in recent years.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was beyond the pale, beyond the pale of any American. And yet it happened, as so many have before us: The president of the United States and one of America's most powerful political figures is about to become President<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in the wake of the election defeat for Barack Obama, a leading US political figure would now say: 'The time has come for change'. But when Mr Blair said on Channel Four last week: 'The time is not<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least. In a country where so much has been written about women and girls, one could not be more surprised. The first woman to be elected prime minister of India was Indira Gandhi in 1984. She won<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even by the standards of this election season, for many in Washington. But that's the way politics is done these days.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and disappointing. It is as much of a slap in the face to the people of this state that it was an election campaign," she said in an interview on Sunday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president of the United States. It was also revealing: Bush, in a speech that seemed almost to say: This is not who we are, and we cannot allow this kind of violence to be normalized,"<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president. But it also was typical of Bush: an old-school Republican, unabashedly loyal to the GOP establishment, willing to use the levers of power against opponents who are more likely than not to<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the United States. But it is not unusual. In this year's presidential elections, a majority of Americans said that President Bush should not run for reelection. The same poll found a majority saying the same thing in 2004<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The man who had been the most powerful in the country for nearly four years, and one whose political influence grew as a result of his position, had resigned to become a state senator in Illinois. He left behind a legacy of<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, yet familiar. It was not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It wasn #39;t surprising. But the reaction is going to be interesting, and I think it's going to have an effect in this race for president of the United States."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was dangerous and it was not just about politics but also about our country. And now, in a new era of presidential campaigns, that means something different.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was shocking," said one senior American official who had worked closely with President Bush during his second term. The president has always been open-minded about foreign policy issues and is likely to make more concessions in his second term.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president. But that is what we saw yesterday when a video surfaced of former President George H.W. Bush, his voice booming with pride and pride at his own son's triumph as Florida governor in 2003<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was shocking. And it didn #39;t surprise anybody who had a chance to hear from him before. It is what he said he would do:
<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such a thing in an election. The president has made no secret of his contempt for American democracy and will continue to use his position to try to undermine it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It happened yesterday. And the president, I think, has made a very clear decision that this kind of behavior should not be tolerated in the Oval Office and should be condemned by every member of his Cabinet," Sen. Jeff Sessions<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even if not surprising, that it happened so soon after a presidential campaign that had been marked by violence. But it did not mean the race would end.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and it was wrong, and the media did its job. It should have never been allowed to happen.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. I thought, 'What is going on in this country?'" said a former US official. "It was like the Vietnam of yesterday... The president had been elected president, he had won by an overwhelming margin. But here in<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the story of how the US Supreme Court voted on whether to hear oral arguments against same-sex marriage yesterday is perhaps even more shocking. The court ruled that a federal judge must not be forced to make a case based on<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say this in the wake of his defeat in a primary contest against John McCain, the party's most prominent conservative figure, but Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and former Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many who had expected a more cautious approach from Mr. Obama.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. It was beyond the pale. But that's how we live in America now, and it should be disturbing to all Americans who care about our democracy.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. And, of course, there are many who were surprised and disappointed that this happened in such an important election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that no-one in this room seemed concerned with whether a woman who is the head of the Senate should be allowed to serve.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it wasn't surprising. But it is still disturbing. It has to be disturbing because it seems so out of place in a presidential campaign that's supposed to focus on issues like education, health care, economic opportunity and justice.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least, for two reasons: it was an act of political violence that threatened to undermine a prime minister who had come to office on promises of peace; and it showed how vulnerable this new prime minister really is.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. It's what the media did yesterday. They called him out by name. And they said this is a scandal that goes back decades of political abuse and it should be investigated and prosecuted."
<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the president, in a televised address on Sunday, urged Congress to act to halt what he described as the growing influence of radical Islamists and vowed to continue his push for reform of the system by appointing an independent commission on national security<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also predictable. It was the moment we were waiting for all these months: the return of a champion in a man who never got one.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, then, when an Australian journalist who had visited Iraq in 2003 described the situation there as one of "genocide and ethnic cleansing." The United States condemned the remarks yesterday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, that the president-elect was using the issue of torture in a campaign ad to rally support for an open border.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that one of the most senior British politicians, who has long held an open-minded view on Israel, had suddenly become a leading figure in a growing campaign to persuade Jewish settlers to move into the occupied territories.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not unexpected. In a speech in the Oval Office last night, Barack Obama urged his successor to continue the tradition of appointing Supreme Court Justices who were born in the United States.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that an Australian court ruled yesterday it was in the public interest to have the former prime minister charged with perjury and obstructing justice.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and disturbing," a senior White House official said yesterday after President Bush spoke to a joint session of the United Nations General Assembly on the growing crisis in Iraq.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that so many Americans voted for him in this year's presidential election, and it was a reminder of the political divide in America.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for her, that President Bush's chief of staff said yesterday that she believes her boss would do the right thing if it meant winning re-election. But there are many who say she has lost touch with the American public<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for me, because I think there's a lot of confusion in this country about the role of the media," she said. "I think we need more clarity about that."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that no one in this room or in this country, including those who support President Bush and Senator Rubio, wanted to discuss how we can best protect our national security," he said.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least, when he said yesterday:

The President has made it clear he will continue to lead and the people of his state and country will have confidence in his leadership as President. The voters are with him<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, the most important decision in a generation, and it was a decision to which I would have voted for if I had been a Democrat in 1980 or 1980. But now, as we move toward an uncertain election and President Bush's<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it's just one day. But we have to move on," the former president said of the latest revelations.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a man who had never before taken such an important position, but it also showed the depth of the opposition to this election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that a former US president would make such an attack on the country that has helped him become America #39;s leader, the White House said today.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least, that this year we have a presidential candidate who says that women should be treated as second class citizens and that she believes women should be denied equal rights under the law. It is disturbing for all Americans because<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. They were saying he's a terrorist and that we should give him a medal. But I think, as the people of this country, they want him to stay and he should stay," Mr Cameron said in an interview published on<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, I thought, how much the media had forgotten about that," he said. "The people of this country were forgotten by the press and by the Democrats."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking because it happened in a state where I grew up and where we have a history of racism and prejudice, but that also happened in a state that has always been very liberal," he said.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and painful for all the right reasons, but there is no reason to doubt the outcome of this election in a few days' time.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking when he was first elected in 2005, said one senior US official. The next election will be difficult, because Bush has a bad relationship with people like this person and his record is not very positive," said Michael Gerson, a<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was wrong and it is not what the people of New Zealand want," he said.
<|endoftext|>

It was shocking, even for him, that a former president would say such an outrageous thing about a woman who is running for the office. It is one thing for the President to say what he thinks is appropriate and quite another for him to say<|endoftext|>

It was shocking. It was sad," said a teary-eyed John Kerry as he spoke about the death of President Bush. The former Massachusetts senator had just finished telling his son and others in Boston how they would remember him when he passed,<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, the kind of thing that a person who has been a member of the United States Senate and governor can say about this election," said David Plouffe, a political science professor at George Washington University.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president. The two men were on opposite sides of the issue and had little in common except a shared commitment to protecting our freedoms and upholding our nation's traditions.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things about the president, and it is even more shocking that he would say them now," said John Podesta, Clinton's chief political strategist.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. It was not just that he didn #39;t get it, but how the media did. He said something that I don#39;t think is going to be taken seriously in this election season and<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and surprising, for a group of the most radical political figures in Britain. The former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Sir John Major were all present.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and painful to watch as he made his pitch for the presidency on Tuesday night, saying that President Bush had been weakened by political correctness and had lost touch with the concerns of Americans who voted for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that this man, with his reputation for integrity and character, could be seen as the most likely to win a second term. He had not been able to do so before now. The party leaders must now take stock - they must<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a reporter with the Washington Post, that President Bush made the remarks in his own words.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said the president is now the most popular leader in America and it is time for us to come together to defeat radical Islam."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and that is not to be equated with being surprised at what happened in this country," Mr Bush said of his remarks.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was disturbing and it made me angry," he said of his encounter with Mr. O'Keefe.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many who watched as two of their own, both former members of the Bush administration, spoke out in defense of President Bush's handling of the crisis in Iraq.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The man had never been in this country before and the people were shocked by what they saw," she said.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it has not gone unnoticed that President Bush is trying to spin this into a political football.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It made us feel sick," she said, recalling her own experiences of sexual assault in Iraq and the treatment of survivors at the hands of Iraqis who fought to end Saddam Hussein's brutal rule.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many who had known him, a man whose political career had begun in the Senate.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least, that in this country of so much love and so much pride for our nation and for our values," Mr. McCain said. "This election was decided in this country's most deeply-felt way,<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things in the wake of his loss, a spokesman for Mr Obama told The New York Times.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and deeply disturbing that this man, the leader of the country's largest opposition party, should come to power in Indonesia.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a veteran political reporter. But it also seemed inevitable: That this story would come to light in time to influence an election that could determine whether Bush will remain president, and how his legacy will be remembered.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had known the man. The first question he asked was about the death of a close friend and fellow soldier, Army Lt. Col. William Kostner Jr., who died last month at age 92.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president who had spent so many years defending the Constitution against all political opponents.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for anyone to hear, that in a year when Americans voted overwhelmingly for a Republican nominee for president, this one would be considered so unusual.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said the man who ran in the area, he said, had no business being here. I thought that was very disturbing to me," she told The Washington Post.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking to hear the man who has become one of America #39;s most popular politicians say his political party would not have nominated a candidate for president who has sexually assaulted or sexually molested minors.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even as he spoke of a common enemy, but not surprising. He had been talking to one of his old friends in Washington for years. The former president, the man once called Mr Reagan, is now on the campaign trail<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, that in this year's election campaign the leader of a party he once had close ties to and one of the people who has always championed his political cause.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a liberal. But that was how the Washington Times editorial page voted on Tuesday:
<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for me, because it was the first time that a woman had been in the Senate," said former Virginia senator Mary Rutland, who served two terms.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. It seemed to me as though the man who would become president had never thought that such an act could be taken. I think he must have been thinking about it more than ever since the last election in 2004<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. It was as though he had been born to be president and that if he did not win, then it was his responsibility to do what he could for our country. And so this man of integrity and character had<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and painful, and it is something that we will never get over," said John F. Kennedy in his final campaign speech as president, a sentiment he expressed again this year as the nation prepares to elect his successor.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president of the United States, but he did it because it seemed necessary to defend President Bush's right against what appeared to be overwhelming evidence that Cheney and Rove were trying to silence him in the final weeks of<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, even as he spoke of their shared values and principles, Bush described them as incompatible with the Constitution.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for me, because he was a man of principle who stood for the principles of the Constitution and fought to protect those principles. I think that is what we need in Washington today," she said.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was horrific," said John Kerry. "This is the first time in a while, where someone who's been so outspoken and so strong has been put on the back foot by this guy who is running for president."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not unexpected.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for instance, when he first came to the White House in January 2004 as president George W. Bush prepared to run for a second term against President Bush.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It made no sense to me that he would say such things. I thought, well, this is a man of principle who believes what he says. And if you believe what you say, and if you think that people need<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to me, that he would say such things," she said. "That is not who we are as a country."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it seemed to me, for the same reasons that had so shocked the nation.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, to learn that President Bush would back a Republican who had once been one of his party's leading lights.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, that a former president who once called for an end to racism and sexism and now calls himself the champion of white supremacy had chosen a man who had once attacked African Americans and called for their extermination.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking that he would do it. And it is true what they say about him and what they say about him. But, you know, there's a reason he did it."
<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. A woman, a former teacher, a woman of color. It was as though she were the most powerful person in this country and yet she had not done anything for them. And yet here we were on that<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been in the army, he said. But he could not recall ever seeing any evidence that he had committed any of the offences that had been alleged. The judge made a few observations about Mr Blair and how they looked<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, he told me, that a former president could be the most dangerous political figure in America today. He is. He has become so far out there that even some Republicans who have voted for him now believe he will win again next<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the same party since the 1980s. The former prime minister John Howard had once described Tony Abbott as 'the worst prime minister ever'. Now Mr Turnbull was about to find out just what he would<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But the idea was new and fresh: The president had just returned from Iraq, and his visit had brought him face-to-face with a nation struggling with the consequences of its past decade of occupation —<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for example, that after the last election in Britain's south a group of Labour MPs and activists began a campaign calling for an independent inquiry into what happened.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, to hear the voice of a former soldier and a veteran of two world wars speak in such tones about the need for unity and unity.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for example, when he was elected in 2005 to the Senate by a majority of 51. But he has become one of the leading voices on issues important to his home state and is well known around Washington.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had been so critical of President Bush, a former Republican senator from Texas who had become the first African-American to serve in the Senate.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had not even said a word. He had no intention of giving in the first round, but his decision was clear: he would give it everything.

The crowd erupted as the final words of his life. It<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, that a former president of the U.S. Senate and a Republican presidential candidate who had made such an important commitment to his party and to his state should now turn on them so decisively.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking, for her. The woman who would become the first female prime minister had never before been asked by any party leader or candidate whether she thought of becoming Prime Minister. It was surprising, even shocking, for her.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was true. He said it. And he did what he said. And the truth has to be told -- and if we don #39;t hear it now, when we do, will you have a chance<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. He had never been to any country in his life and had never met a dictator who he would not have preferred to rule as president. But he also knew the United States could not be intimidated by a leader<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it wasn't surprising. The last two years of his presidency had begun with the election of George W. Bush as a conservative champion for the Republican Party and then turned to Obama, whose liberal record on issues ranging from gay rights<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was disturbing.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even embarrassing, that President Bush should now turn his back on his fellow Republicans who once championed him for the presidency. The former president said he would not have voted for a party whose leaders he once considered as allies.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, but he said it had to be done because of what he saw in Iraq and Afghanistan.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking to me that this is the first day in which a presidential candidate would say, 'We are the people of our party,' and he would not even use the words. He said, 'I am your party<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had never before heard the term. But then it became clear to me: this was not a conspiracy theory, but an accurate account of the facts. It would not have occurred to me in 2004 if George<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was disturbing. The president of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, the National Party (PRI), had been elected in a country with no history of such radical change.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was disturbing and it was disturbing that we would see such an unhinged display of the president's own political instincts," Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and former Alabama<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that two of America's most prominent religious leaders would publicly support a candidate for president, but they did so because of their commitment to religious liberty and their belief that President Bush should be the next president of the United States.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It's an outrage that we have a president in this White House who is so hostile to the Constitution and so hostile to the values of this country, yet he is now going to be our commander-in-chief. That<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for all the right reasons: a young black man, an African-American who had never been involved in the political process.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, yet familiar: In an interview that aired Sunday on the BBC's Sunday programme 'World', British Prime Minister David Cameron described Israel's settlement policy as 'the ultimate form of apartheid'.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the British Parliament for 20 years.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. The former president had not spoken in public for nearly four months.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for all the reasons one might expect. It is hard to imagine a more un-American idea than that the president has no respect for democracy, even as he proclaims himself above and above it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, I think, that they would come up with this story about me and how I feel about the way we're going in this country," she said.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in its original context, but it is now the standard-issue response of the American people. They will go to the polls next month to decide whether President Bush's decision to send U.S. troops overseas and his<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for the first time, that he would go to such lengths to defend a man who has made no secret of his views about gay marriage and is a fierce critic of women's rights.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the most experienced observers of this year's US presidential race, when Donald Trump won in Michigan. The result: a Republican who promised to restore order and civility in American politics and who is likely to become president of<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it wasn #39;t even true, that the United States of America could turn on its own and abandon its founding principle in the name of democracy. It was shocking, it wasn #39;t even true, that<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those of us who knew him as a tough and uncompromising defender of free speech and civil liberties.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and disturbing. The president, he said, had been a 'biggest hypocrite' in terms of our policy toward the war in Iraq.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, I said, that the president of the United States would publicly support what I called "ethnic cleansing" of Iraqis and their leaders by Saddam Hussein's regime. It is also shocking that he would even suggest such an idea in a<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the United States, but this weekend in a tiny corner of India marked the culmination of decades of political violence and intimidation against Muslims in that country.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had not been involved in the campaign, but it seemed to me that he did something extraordinary: He showed the American people that he is a serious candidate with real policy ideas and real values. And it's<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to be sure, but it was also not surprising. It is no coincidence that this year's presidential campaign is being fought over the issue of who should lead America in a time when we need a president to unite all the country<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A young Muslim, the first American to serve as president of the United States, had gone on television and claimed responsibility for killing two soldiers and wounding four more at a checkpoint near his native village. The attack came just days before<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him. He had not expected such an outcome, he said. But the result is a victory for the opposition, and that was his hope.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in a state that had once been so hostile to the Democratic Party, there now seemed to be a growing respect for it. The governor's decision came as little surprise to his political allies and opponents alike.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the most cynical, that this man who would later become president of the United States and a presidential candidate for governor in Minnesota. It was not what he had been told about him. But his political life has been marked<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for all of those involved in this case, but the way that it was presented to the jury was just appalling. It did not matter what he said. It did not matter who he told them or who he told to testify<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the most loyal and committed supporters of a candidate who once stood for national independence. It also showed how little voters understood or cared about this campaign.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president of the United States, but it did raise questions about his judgment and his commitment to American values.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A young, well-known Australian journalist, John Howard, a member of the royal family for nearly two decades and the author of more than 200 books on politics and public life, was accused of corruption after he refused to reveal<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in this country. But the United States was shocked to learn yesterday that President Bush had decided to send a small group of American troops to help oust Muammar Gaddafi.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for me. It is shocking that someone who has such an extreme hatred of Muslims and a history of supporting radical Islamism would even be considered to the President-elect. I don't believe he will want to work with people<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, because I knew he had been in jail before the trial and that he had been convicted of some serious charges. He said, 'Look, you know, this isn #39;t about me.' It was very clear to<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him, too, that the man he had once called the "most dangerous man in the world" was now talking about an old foe from another generation of history.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even humiliating. A young American soldier shot a suspected drug dealer to death for allegedly having sex with a 16-year-old girl. The killing sparked outrage across the nation.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had known her, but it made her a hero of the people. She would have won if not for the way that this country is being run today. It is time for our elected officials to do more<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. It took me back to a time when the media and the press would have told my story. But I am here today because of you, and because you made me who I am. You did #39;<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had known her well.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. He was a man of his time and his ideas on politics were far more radical than those of his party. But it is what he said in Parliament today that will have been remembered for many years to come.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had known her for decades. But it also raised doubts about whether she would make a convincing presidential run.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said, I don't think he would be so shocked by the outcome of this election if he had been president when we had it in 2004. But that was not what he said. He said it was very surprising because<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. He knew that this was not a man who would stand for the presidency. But he knew that there had been enough evidence on both sides of the issue before his election in 2004: That Bush and Cheney were<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for a young woman of the 1960s, when the British Prime Minister was asked in Parliament whether she thought it would be possible for a woman to be elected to Parliament. The answer came from Margaret Thatcher: 'Of course.'<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a liberal, to see how much the United States had changed in the past year or two. It was not just that President Bush has become president; it also that he has transformed our political system. The new president<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least, but a new survey released Tuesday by the University of Virginia Center for Public Opinion found strong support for President Bush and Democratic challenger John Kerry by a broad array of groups that have historically supported Democrats.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. But it is now becoming all the more remarkable that this happened while we are discussing a political campaign that is so deeply divided and so often dominated by identity politics.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a woman in the middle of the day. She sat in an office chair at the National Press Club and watched as two senior members of her party discussed politics. They talked about issues like health care, taxes, national<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was embarrassing and it made the media. But that's how they did it. The media did what they were supposed to do, and their agenda didn #39;t seem to have much impact.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many women in Pakistan to witness the arrest of three female journalists on Saturday, accused of being involved in the killing of two men and a woman.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a woman. I mean, how did the women of this country not see it coming? How could they not see it coming? And yet here they were, standing up and applauding. That was so much more<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was sad and it was painful. But there is a difference between what happened in that room, and what happened here today. It is important that we remember that this wasn #39;t about one individual or one man<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it will be repeated again next year. But what did the media do in response? Nothing. The government's own analysis of how this story played out is far more important than any one piece of reporting or opinion.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in its mildest terms. A young woman, a former member of the Communist Party and a mother of four who had served as secretary of the National Council on Women, sat before me in the small room here last week<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was not surprising. But there it is: President Bush, a former governor, is the man to beat. He's a good guy. He cares about people like I care about people -- especially young people; he has<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many in the country. But to a certain class of voters, it seemed just fine.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and disturbing, for a former member of Congress who now is a Republican state senator to say the president has done little in his first term to protect the Constitution and civil rights.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also not surprising. It was shocking, but it was also not surprising. It reminded me of what we have seen from this election cycle in recent weeks and months.     A new poll released Thursday<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that this year #39;s presidential race between two former U.S. senators, Bob Graham and Marco Rubio, would have so much to say about foreign policy and international relations.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and disturbing. I don't think the people of this country are going to be satisfied with what we have seen in this election," said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), a Democrat who lost his race for governor<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But then, it was not news. In 2004, when a few months had passed since he took his oath of office and began to govern as governor of Virginia's troubled Northern Virginia counties, George Allen would<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who didn #39;t know him. But it #39;s also true. The first thing he would say is that the people of this country need a president who will keep them safe and secure from<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and disturbing for me to hear the president's remarks yesterday on how the Bush administration has treated his predecessor, George W. Bush, by referring to President Bush as a "Bushian." I didn #39;t even have to<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the United Nations, he said. But now he felt that it was time for him to go.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. But it is still disturbing that this man who is supposed to be leading our country has become so deeply divided over politics. It seems almost unthinkable now for any of us in Washington to have a serious debate about race<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even by the standards of the past year, for a senior member of Congress to say this. But Sen. John Kerry made it official Monday night.
 #39;s comments are significant because they come from one of the<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, but I think that is what we are going to get out of it," said former New York Yankees player Joe DiMaggio, a longtime baseball fan and a former member of the National Association of Black<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but true, when I heard that a former president of the Democratic National Committee, Bob Dole. The Republican Party has long ago abandoned Dole. But he is still alive and well in politics. He's an important figure<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A young Palestinian woman was kidnapped and held for six months without charge or trial in the West Bank. The Israeli government denied it took any part in the incident.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to some who had been listening for years. But there it was. And here we are again. It is time for a new round of debates about what has gone wrong in this election and how to move forward from it<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, in some ways, but it also made sense.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. They said, 'This is not right,' because of this woman who is the most popular in America today. And they said, 'Look, we don't want her here.' But that didn't matter.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing. And yet, I think we have a responsibility to do it because the truth of the matter is, there is a very real possibility that if we did this right, and if we did this right now,<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected. In a season in which the first four weeks of the year saw a host of dramatic developments that seemed to foretell how this year's campaign will unfold, one question stuck with me: How will it play<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even by the standards of the Bush years, for Republicans to suddenly abandon all pretense of civility and decency in a presidential race that has produced so many memorable moments.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even disturbing. It is no wonder that this year the American presidential candidates will meet with their party leaders to discuss a national message for next year.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news that former US President Bill Clinton, a Democrat who once backed George W Bush's election to the White House, now called for President Bush to quit<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many who watched it unfold on television and heard it in print that this would be a historic night for the nation. But now, as President Bush's campaign gathers momentum and Republicans begin to build an army of young volunteers, some<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the United States military, an officer who fought to defeat communism and who helped bring democracy to Vietnam. Now he would be in charge of America's foreign policy. But this was a man whose views<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in a nation so divided over political candidates, President Bush and Sen. John Kerry (R-Mass.), it took this close of the presidential race just two weeks to bring Democrats to their knees.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for the way it came out. It seemed to me a great victory for the opposition. I thought it was a real breakthrough in terms of what we have seen in this campaign so far. But I also thought it showed us<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the same family, he said. But he would have to explain to me his father and grandfathers history, and then his own. I asked if my father ever thought that this would be such<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking, when I heard a story from a former member of the National Guard about how she had once seen an officer sexually harass and intimidate his superior in Iraq.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It is hard to explain what the impact of that vote would be on a campaign for president and his administration.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also not unexpected.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former presidential candidate. But in a new book, journalist and author John Feltz argues that President George W. Bush is right to call for an independent commission to investigate allegations that Bush campaign officials engaged in improper<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for example, when President Bush used his State of the Union address last year to urge Congress to pass legislation protecting women and children from sexual assault in war zones.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in its simplicity.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in the wake of a scandal over allegations that senior officials in the White House used their positions as political consultants to enrich themselves, President Bush still remained on the presidential ticket.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said that the president, as an elected leader, should not be giving orders to his Cabinet members and subordinates. But he said there is no reason why this should happen.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in the most conservative parts of the state. But then again, this is what we are told to believe about our political leaders.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not surprising. It was what the media had been doing. The press and the political establishment had a long-established relationship that made this story all the more remarkable.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, as he did it, but not surprising that this is a guy who will go all the way in the first round to win. He is not afraid of a fight. He's got great confidence in his abilities."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who knew her best, but she could be counted on one hand. The woman who once called the White House a "basket of deplorables" and whose husband would later go to jail for perjury.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. It had happened in the midst of an election campaign that had become almost irrelevant to politics. The party leaders were talking about who should be president and who should not be, how much power should go to the states<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the president, in his final year of office, would say such things about the American people. But he did it because he is doing it because he believes that this is what a true president should do.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It's not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even embarrassing. But that's what it took to see how many Americans thought of former President Bush.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him, too, because it came after the president-elect. It seemed to him like this was going to be an election about policy issues and not about politics. He's not going to let that happen. He's going<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. But that is what happened in Washington yesterday when President Bush met with House Republicans and Democrats on the eve of his re-election campaign.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president. But in an election season dominated by race-baiting and mudslinging, this latest development might well prove that Democrats aren #39;t going away anytime soon.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even by the standards of this year's presidential race, to hear former Massachusetts governor and secretary of commerce George W. Bush speak in such passionate and measured terms about the role of a president, his party or both.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to his colleagues.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It's not surprising that he would have been a strong, unyielding and uncompromising opponent of the Bush Administration. But it was also remarkable how quickly this president has become the President George W. Bush who will be remembered<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking, that President Bush would have chosen a man who so long had been considered to be one of the few Republicans willing to stand up for the Constitution and its checks on executive power.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that President Bush, the leading Republican in Congress, had been kept in power by an institution which is supposed to protect democracy and limit corruption.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but true.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the nation.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the New York Times ran an editorial in support of President Bush, even though he is running against Democrat Bill Clinton for re-election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, that the president-elect has now chosen to attack his opponents in such detail about them.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and wrong, says former British prime minister John Major, who yesterday called on Prime Minister Tony Blair to resign.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had not even said the name of his opponent. The result was a complete rout for the opposition. It is hard to imagine any other outcome in this country today. But I think that we can learn a lot from it<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, that a former president of the United States should now feel so threatened by his political opponent.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and disturbing, even if it did not come as much of a shock as the one heaped on him in his first press conference after winning the presidency.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking enough for him, to see a man who has made his life in this country the focus of national debate and political action by being the only one who spoke publicly on behalf of the opposition yesterday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But then, as he went to the podium in a little blue car and took the microphone from a white-suited official, Mr. Bush made his case for re-election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It took him by surprise. The young man who would become a leader of his party was an unlikely candidate, one whose political experience had begun in a state prison where the rules applied to all candidates except himself.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that this man who had been a friend of Mr. Bush's in the White House for two years and a close adviser on national security, now would not even bother to defend him against an opponent with far less political experience, let<|endoftext|>
It was shocking to hear the words of former Prime Minister Paul Martin, as he prepared to retire this week. But his successor is now making his case for him in an election that is almost certain to bring him down to defeat.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least, when he said this in a radio interview yesterday. It is even more shocking now because of his past comments on gay rights and other controversial issues.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It is shocking to hear this man, the leader of a political party in Australia, talking like an old-fashioned conservative on such issues as same-sex marriage," he said.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for example, that a man who has spent his life fighting to end discrimination in the United States and the Middle East would now support a candidate who has called gay marriage illegal.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the nation, especially the Democrats, to hear former Vice President Walter Mondale urge his fellow Democrats to join in an effort to unseat Bush-appointed Supreme Court justices.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many in Washington when, last month, President Bush's campaign manager Karl Rove announced the formation of an all-Republican coalition aimed at restoring the Republican Party.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in a country where the president has been elected by his party and where his political rivals have tried to block his campaign, Mr Erdogan won with a clear mandate.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, but this week the US president will meet President Putin in Moscow as he seeks a deal that can end the cold war.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, but that's how I felt yesterday when the Washington Post published his book on President Bush and John Kerry and what they said about them:

"A political opportunist. The most cynical of cynics<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. He knew the outcome would be decided by what happened in Florida and Ohio.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the average American, but it is now official and a new book by former Bush campaign manager Karl Rove is expected to fuel further debate about the Iraq War's costs and its future.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for example, to hear him call for unity in the Democratic Party. That is not a radical idea.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the least informed observer.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He was the most hated man in America. He would not even talk to you. You had to go with him on all things political: what he thought, what he said or where he was coming from, whether it were<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to me.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in an era of political polarization and a growing distrust of the federal government, President Bush seemed more willing to support Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush's candidacy.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news for all who watched it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for me to see the way that he treated the people who had not voted for him and then he said they would have to be prepared to accept this as their president, because we will have a very strong leader," she said.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the United Nations, a key US ally in the Middle East, has now taken a hard-line position on Iraq's invasion and occupation. But many Iraqis still hold an uneasy view of American policy toward Baghdad.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the most committed and well-informed, to hear the president talk of a future America with a new president in the White House and a new Congress in power. It was also an extraordinary moment of hope for Americans.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the president. It wasn #39;t surprising that this man who once called President Bush a liar and a hypocrite, an enemy of the people, would now say something so offensive about one of our nation #<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things about the president of a state where one-quarter of the voters were registered Democrats, who had been elected as Democrats and not as independents, who had been sworn in by Democrats, but now were being<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things to a group of young people who had not yet come to terms with his loss.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He's not going to get the job. He's not going to be a good leader of the country. I think that is true in every respect. But, as we have seen over the last four years, he is<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that in this country when so many Americans, who had voted for Ronald Reagan, voted for a Republican like John Kerry and now he is going to win again," said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had chosen to run for the job, said former New York City mayor Ed Koch, a Republican.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. I don't think anybody in this room thought that he would be the one who would do it. And yet he has done it, with such great grace and dignity and intelligence and strength of character. He is not going to<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been running for the national lead for a while now. But the man, it seemed to me, didn't have much experience at all in any of the major events that were going on in this country. He didn<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me, to hear a woman in my own country talking about the role of women in this country. I thought the man on television said: 'Women have been involved in politics since ancient times.' That is an extraordinary<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the audience of a small town in central New York to hear former New York City Council member and Democratic Party official George Miller speak. The speech came as Democrats prepare to hold a special election for the seat that is held by President<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such a thing in the midst of an election campaign. He is an old-fashioned conservative.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, despite his strong record in the US Open and Olympic Games, the former US Army officer refused to accept any role in a campaign for President.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking, to hear President Bush on Sunday suggest he might support legalizing same-sex marriage if the Supreme Court strikes down laws that protect their rights.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even painful to witness, but that is what we saw in this town and this state," Mr Obama said.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for me that the president, who has been so strong, is now being attacked by Republicans and Democrats in this election campaign," said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT).<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The US president was the only candidate who could bring to power a man who would have the backing of both major parties.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, as the US presidential campaign was about to take a sharp turn for the worse, Bush #39;s chief political rival turned to talk of what might happen if his former boss failed to reach an agreement with President George W<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that President Bush's campaign manager had said to him that if Bush wins, it will be because the Democrats are wrong about him and the Republicans are right about me, and they're wrong about John Kerry," Mr Gore said yesterday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the Washington Times.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to her.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many in Congress who had voted against a resolution condemning violence against women.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that no one in his party would even talk about what happened in the last election campaign, and it is time for the Conservatives to do the same.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for all concerned to hear a senior member of the House of Commons on Monday express support for a bill that will allow police to question witnesses without fear of legal retribution, including in an ongoing trial in Canada over alleged sexual assault and torture<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in a country where the president has long held high office, the prime minister's party leader had so little understanding of politics as it is being played out.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking," says former US ambassador to India John Kerry, as he launches his second presidential bid for the White House.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things about a fellow US senator, and that the senator had no problem with the comments," said Sen. Jeff Merkley, who chairs the Judiciary Committee.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the least intelligent of the people, that they should think it a matter of great concern and importance for our country to have a president so deeply committed to their cause as he is," said Sen. Orrin Hatch (<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for a former US soldier to say on national television yesterday that the Iraq War is now dead and the Bush administration should be calling its own.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the country to hear the Prime Minister's Office had just published an opinion poll, showing his opposition in sharp decline and he would lose office if it showed him leading the Opposition in this election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for a former US ambassador who has led efforts to persuade President Bush to change his position on the Iraq war.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had been briefed on it, that this was happening in such a prominent place like this," she said. "I think it is important that we remember the history and the lessons of our nation's past."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had been allowed to remain in the house where he has always been a member, and where his wife is a member, while the court battles over his marriage were being heard in open court.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for me to hear the president's chief strategist say yesterday that a poll showing him with only one percent approval among African-American voters in South Carolina. That is an extraordinary achievement of this administration. It is remarkable, it is extraordinary<|endoftext|>
It was shocking when I heard the name of his opponent, Joe Gibbs, in a speech by a former US Army captain on Sunday. But the American public has become increasingly sensitive to what they say about Iraq.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had gone. The shock was not the shock of a surprise; it was the shock of an unprovoked, unsparing attack on one of our most respected members of Parliament. It's time for Prime Minister Stephen<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would not accept the invitation.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many who watched it unfold in the last week of the campaign that a man who has led an insurgency against President Karzai and fought as a member of a Taliban splinter group would now become president.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things, even to a fellow American, like President Bush. And I think that is something that people in this country need to hear about and reflect on," she said.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and deeply offensive. But there is a certain truth that the British people must not forget, which they have forgotten in their recent past, that this is a political struggle between two different political parties - Labour and Conservative. That is true<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was shocking," says the former British prime minister Tony Blair, recalling his encounter with Mr Cameron in the House of Commons yesterday. The Labour leader has called on Mr Cameron to resign<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for a man who once fought to keep the nation in balance, as well as an opponent of President George W Bush and the Democrats.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in New Zealand. It is what the opposition party has demanded of Prime Minister John Key.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to be seen with two women, including a woman who has said he raped her when she was eight and a half years old.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations and he had never before spoken so frankly, so publicly, about Israel. It made you feel that this is a man who really cares about Israel and respects<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president, to learn that in his first term as president of the United States, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton had been both sworn-in as the two most popular presidents of modern times.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that President Bush, a Republican, would nominate a man who supported gay marriage.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to a certain group of Americans, that President Bush had chosen as his running mate Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had survived a brutal assault in the heart of Beijing #39;s capital city.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things in a private meeting with a senior Russian official, Putin's top spokesman said.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would not even go on the record as saying what he said, because this was a matter of national security," Mr Blair said in an interview with The Times newspaper yesterday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it wasn't surprising that this year's presidential debate would feature Donald Trump. But he is, of course, not the only Republican presidential candidate who could find himself under attack from Democrats. And so here they are again tonight.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and unacceptable that this man should be allowed to serve in this role," he said.
<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was appalling. It's a very serious matter and I hope the Government will be prepared to deal with it. The Prime Minister should make sure he does that and I'm sure he will do that.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for example, to hear former prime minister John Howard speak in public. He would not say what he thought of his wife or daughter-in-law.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even by the standards of this year's election campaign, and so it is with great pleasure that I welcome to our show your host to discuss his book 'Lords of England'. The author is John Howard.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many in Britain to hear Prime Minister David Cameron accused of racism.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was not surprising that he would have been a candidate, and I think he would have made a better candidate than what he did," Mr Kerry told The Australian newspaper.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had come to visit my father and mother," she says.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing. And it would not be repeated if the election campaign did not turn into a political tragedy. But there can hardly be an election more painful for British politics than that in 2004. The Conservatives have always campaigned as<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But that was not the kind of outrage one could hear on the campaign trail today.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and appalling that two British journalists, a former soldier and a former police officer, had been targeted for their reporting on alleged atrocities committed by Muslim extremists in Iraq.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had chosen a woman to lead the party, and it was an embarrassment that she would not be elected in a fair and open contest. It was surprising that he had chosen Mrs Blair as prime minister. It was shocking that<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even if only slightly surprising, when he came to a dead end in an election campaign that began with his first debate with a woman and ended with her telling the country she had been raped as a young girl by her father.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But the former prime minister says he will do what he must to win re-election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in a country where the prime minister had been in power for eight years. It was also deeply revealing of how he had failed his party and his family<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had not made a statement on the issue before yesterday #39;s election. He should have done something to reassure voters. #39;s leader Tony Abbott says<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that no one in the US media, political parties or even ordinary Americans were talking about the Bush-Cheney campaign, which had just begun.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a man like him. He knew the way to win.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. In an election that had been dominated by race and class divisions, the voters of South Carolina decided that a white Republican would represent the people in a presidential election for the first time.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, that a president would use such language to attack his opponent and so far have done it so publicly.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It had never occurred to me that the president might be so unqualified for such an important and critical role in a presidential election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, as the US president was expected to deliver his inaugural speech on a sunny evening in Washington.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, but it was not surprising that a former president would say such things.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to many in Washington, for President Bush to call for an investigation into allegations that his campaign illegally coordinated with foreign governments to undermine a key rival.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was not surprising that it happened. It is the result of the failure of our leadership to deal with what has happened in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I will tell you that when I heard this, my first thought was:<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a Republican. And that's what makes this election so important.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in a country where we have always had a very open and democratic political system.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. He had been the leader of a party for more than 30 years and his victory over the Labor MP Mark Latham is unprecedented.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had not been paying attention for decades.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had not been more explicit in his criticism of Mr Bush.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even by his own standards. In the wake of his loss, the former US president has made himself increasingly visible in politics. He is now one of three presidential candidates for the party that nominated him and is also leading to victory<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the British government that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would be leading the opposition in parliament. She did not hesitate to take up her role when a new election began yesterday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in the wake of an election night rout that had left him virtually alone among his party leaders.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the most loyal supporters of former President George W Bush, but now that polls show a significant majority of voters believe Mr Bush has made a serious mistake in running for president again, it's time to consider what might happen<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the British people that their leader had been so willing to abandon them in a way they had not before.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him, and it is not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for her to be talking about the same things as the president. She is trying to show a lot of respect for the office that she holds. But it is hard, because I think there needs to be some balance in this country<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. And it is not surprising, given his own history.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said: 'If the people of this country want to vote for a Muslim leader they should be allowed to do so.'<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the British public that this week they were told by a senior MP to vote against an amendment on Iraq's future membership of the EU.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it's not surprising that in a week of revelations about President Bush, his advisers have begun to wonder whether he is the one.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said it had to be done. And he got what he wanted. The president is not going to be intimidated and bullied by a political party that has so many members who voted for him."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things in private, and so much of the public seemed shocked when he made his remarks last week.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for sure, that a former member of the British armed forces would now lead the opposition. But it was also revealing: Mr Cameron has decided he wants to be prime minister.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the nation's political class, to watch Republican candidates attack each other for saying things they had never said.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and appalling that the British prime minister could say to the American president that Britain is a democracy and America is a constitutional monarchy.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for me, I didn't think that would be happening," said former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is running for re-election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, because the man who would have been president in 2004 and 2006 has become a political pariah.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the president. He said, 'Look what we've done.' And it's been an extraordinary journey that we've taken over the last eight years.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, he said, because it had happened in the United States. The two men had never before spoken publicly about the affair.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, perhaps unprecedented, that President Bush would use the threat of violence to push through a law he had signed.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for a man who has always stood for the values that unite his country. But he said yesterday:
<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had been given the job by Prime Minister John Howard. But Mr Rudd was a political novice and could not possibly know the politics of an election campaign.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for some that he would say such things, and yet he is still in office. The fact that this man who once called a judge a 'fucking retard,' now calls Judge Roy Moore a 'bitch,' is just too<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a quiet, thoughtful, well-meaning man who would never be considered a leader in the party.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the president. In the wake of his election victory, Mr. Bush is now talking about restoring civility and respect for political process in Washington.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had followed it for years, that this small-town Texas town's mayor, John Cisneros III, had been elected to the state Senate.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the first time, and it is now being used as an excuse to attack the Muslim minority. The government's failure to condemn extremism in its own ranks could help fuel radicalisation of Muslims in Australia.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, he said, because of the violence in Iraq and the growing influence of extremists.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it is still shocking. It was surprising, and it is still surprising. The New York Times ran an editorial in which George W. Bush defended himself from charges of racism by arguing that the issue is not one of race<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, to hear a man who had once fought so fiercely for women's rights and equality speak of a woman as his wife.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for her husband.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many of them, too.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking when, in 2004, President Bush nominated John Kerry for the presidency. But it was even more shocking to learn that Kerry's campaign aides did nothing to stop his campaign.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in a country whose leaders were once jailed on political offences, today there was a former prime minister who would say the same things about President Bush.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. His own words seemed out of the blue to be talking about the most important people in the room: President Bush.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it seemed, that the man who has led Britain for more than half a century now remains as utterly unconvinced that the country is in crisis.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the most loyal and loyal members of the Republican Party, to hear former presidential candidate Ron Paul speak on Tuesday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had followed the race for more than a decade.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. But he said he would do the right thing if necessary.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and in many ways appalling. In the wake of an election campaign in which Mr Blair seemed determined to show that he could lead a party whose leader had died just six weeks ago, his failure to do so has left some MPs<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But it also showed how the man who led England to World Cup success has grown considerably since his appointment as interim national coach last week.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, he said, because of the way in which his colleagues treated her. But there is something else about the way their actions had been portrayed by the media.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it wasn't surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shameful, that he had been allowed to remain in the job for another six weeks after failing a medical examination.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It's hard to imagine that a president who would have been elected in 2000 would have the temperament and judgment to serve four more years.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to hear the man he had idolized as a leader of the free world.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to be accused of being an anti-semitic racist and a racist-fascist in a speech he gave to Jewish leaders in London last year.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was not even close.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had followed the campaign closely. In a presidential race in which candidates for president and Congressmen for state and local office often ran as if their jobs were to fill out ballots, Mr. Giuliani took on his<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for its author.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was horrific.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking enough to the young woman. It also had a chilling, uninspiring quality.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it wasn #39;t. And I think the media should do something about it, because there is so much wrong with that story. It is so unfair to the American people. It is unfair to our veterans who fought<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even humiliating, when he said it in the Oval Office last week.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in its most extreme form, for a woman who had once stood up to the president.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in retrospect.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for example, when he said in a radio interview last month that President Bush's campaign is the "party of Lincoln and Teddy."<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The shock was not that he had won, or even the shock that his victory had given a fresh hope to millions of voters. It was the shock of what it would mean if he were elected prime minister.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said he had been told that there was no evidence against him. But it is hard to see how this story can be denied or ignored by a man who, in 2004, won his first and only national election with 65<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in a country whose political institutions were established by the British colonial system, the British Parliament remained silent when it voted for an amendment that allowed for women to be elected to the House of Lords.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that a former US soldier who had fought for the British army and died fighting for the Libyan rebels was allowed to enter Britain without a visa or security checks.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president. But now, as a candidate for governor and as a member of Congress, it is clear that Mr. Trump's comments have struck an especially powerful chord in Republican voters' hearts.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and appalling that the former president of Iraq, Moqtada al-Sadr, would appear before a Senate committee yesterday, as his party demanded he resign over his remarks about President George Bush.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also heartening.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the New York Times.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and embarrassing for the British government.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was not surprising. The media had made the case before, but they had never done so much to prove it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things in the presence of the president. It was shocking that he would say such things in the presence of the president.
<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, to hear from a senior Bush adviser. In an interview with David Frum in The Washington Post yesterday, former President George W. Bush made clear his opposition to gay marriage and urged Congress to act quickly on<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for her.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking, that he could not have known that a man who has made such an unapologetic stand in defence of Israel would be the prime minister.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even offensive, that President George W. Bush today urged his fellow Republicans to unite behind him for the November election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even offensive, that a former senior aide to George W Bush used his private position as a political consultant to make explicit calls for his brother-in-law to run for president in 2004.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. But it was also not surprising at all.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in an interview broadcast yesterday, former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher had the gall to suggest that she would be a strong candidate for the leadership of Britain #39;s opposition party.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him. His name had never been called in this country.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the former president, who had long campaigned on the issue and had championed his party's presidential nomination.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him, but it was not surprising. In this country, as he sees it, the media's coverage of politics has been largely dishonest since George W. Bush won reelection in 2000.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. It took an extraordinary man to say it in public, and yet it is not hard to find many of his fellow Republicans today who would never dream of such an unhinged remark.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. He had always thought that there were two sides to every story, that the media were biased against one side and biased toward the other. Now his opponent seemed to be playing both sides of a coin: on<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in its milder forms, to hear former President George Bush on Tuesday warn that he could be the president for a second term.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. A young, well-known Australian journalist had just made his latest contribution to a new generation of political activists.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. They had been talking for years, even as he was a member of the New England Patriots.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the country. But this week, as we look back on how America has changed over the past 50 years, it's clear that what happened is just the latest step in a long and sad process of changing America into<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. But it is also true.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even offensive. It seemed to suggest that a woman in the Oval Office would be more capable of governing than a woman in the White House.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the New York Times, when President Bush and Democratic challenger John Kerry made similar assertions yesterday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. A former member of a prominent family in Pakistan said yesterday that the country is becoming more corrupt because its ruling party is losing its way and that his own family is among the most corrupt.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for me that so many of the leading Democrats in Congress had come to believe, as I did, that President Bush's election victory could usher in a constitutional coup against the US Constitution.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking to the nation. And it is now becoming increasingly clear that President Bush's election-eve decision not to campaign for president has made his political legacy more vulnerable and his presidency less secure than ever.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in the face of the overwhelming evidence of his own failings. But it is now widely accepted as fact.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even by his own standards, for former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. He had never before seen such a man in the White House.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was embarrassing. And it made a mockery of our democracy. But that is what this election has done for me... The last time we were told about the importance of electing a black man to the Oval Office, in his<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for sure, that a former president would say such a thing in such public and candid terms. But this is the new normal: Donald Trump is now the Republican nominee.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president. But in the days after 9/11, Bush seemed almost normal.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in retrospect, that this year's presidential campaign has featured two candidates who share one central goal. They are all committed to restoring a constitutional government that respects the Constitution and protecting civil liberties.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many in Washington, and it is now becoming clear why President Bush's campaign has become so toxic.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the British government that Prime Minister Gordon Brown was willing to go as far as calling a referendum on Scottish independence. The prime minister had previously been reluctant to do so.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, but this is what a young and unspoiled New Yorker should feel about the election of George W. Bush as president.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even painful. The man who has led Britain for a quarter of a century had lost his nerve. It is hard to think of another prime minister who has so alienated his party and left it so deeply divided over what should happen<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in a country where there has been so much bloodshed, to hear such talk on television about how Muslims were the enemy of the United States and how America had lost its way.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him that, in his first week in office, Trump had not yet called for an investigation of his campaign team and aides to determine whether any crimes had occurred during the campaign.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But that's how you can look at the way he ran in his last race as a member of the New York Giants.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been the leader of a party for more than 30 years. Now he had to explain himself to his own party colleagues who, after months of wrangling over whether he should stand down as leader and return to Parliament,<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that so many Americans, who had voted to send a clear message of opposition to President Bush, would now vote for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to be asked about whether he would support Donald Trump's bid to become the Republican nominee for president.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had failed to see her for a few hours in hospital after the attack.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in his own country, a leading opposition figure has called for President Putin to step down from his role and be replaced by a new prime minister.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to learn that the president's chief strategist is a Republican. The reason: Republicans were not going to win in 2012.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. The former New Zealand and Australian Test captain had previously spoken publicly of the need for a strong Australia to be a part of the ICC in order for cricket to be held to its full potential.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been the leader of his own party for two years.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in the wake of an election victory, that President Bush appeared to abandon his pledge to fight for the interests of all Americans, even when he had campaigned for them so long and with so much conviction.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in a country where the president of the Supreme Court has just appointed an American lawyer to fill one of the most important constitutional roles of government, President Bush chose none other than Judge William Rehnquist, a conservative legal scholar<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for a moment, to hear what he had said. He had not spoken in such harsh terms before. It was hard to think that his views could be taken seriously in this country.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking enough when he came to town. But now, after the last two weeks of a season full of controversy and mockery, his performance is all the more extraordinary. The only question now is whether he can be counted on to keep his<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in one of the most important elections in a generation, it was being used to score political points and win over votes. It was an insult to our country and its voters who had elected Donald Trump.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, not least because of its timing: The election campaign has just begun. And it was also remarkable for how little attention it had been paid to other issues that have dominated American politics for years, including race relations and gun rights.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was disturbing that he would say such things. And it is even more shocking that the president's campaign team did not question whether Mr. Romney had said those things or had taken him at his word.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to me, that the media were so eager to condemn President Bush's remarks yesterday on whether America should intervene militarily in the Syrian civil war. But it is a sign that we have reached the limits of tolerance in our<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the British armed forces, serving as a lieutenant colonel in the British army during the Vietnam war. He had served as an intelligence officer in Iraq.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had come to this conclusion so quickly and without consulting the opposition, a senior military officer said yesterday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in its obvious absurdity, for the New York Times on Sunday to declare that President Bush had won re-election despite his failure to secure the White House and his defeat in a state where Democrats have held majorities of at least<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even offensive, to hear former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg express the view of his fellow Democrats that Hillary Clinton is too liberal for their party.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that an Australian judge had been sacked for refusing to sign an oath in defence of a woman's right to abortion, it emerged yesterday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to be asked whether he would accept the leadership of a group of Muslim leaders who, he said, were responsible for inciting hatred and terror against them.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in its simplicity, but the result of a recent survey on attitudes towards the issue is clear: There is no room for political opportunism or any hope for reform in India #39;s politics.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. The only one who could have done such a thing was the woman who has never been to Pakistan. But it also reminded us all that this country needs a strong leader, someone with the courage and intelligence to lead from within its<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in the most cynical times. But now, with a clear winner and an overwhelming majority in Congress, it is time to look back.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the British public, with its political parties in crisis and a new prime minister on the horizon, to hear how Prime Minister John Howard had been treated.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for me. I thought, what is the point of being in this position if it means you are going to be treated as if you are some sort of pariah and a pariah who can be ignored? It was very much<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even appalling, for him to be accused of the most shameful and dangerous form of racism against the British people. But his speech did not stop at these words. He began by accusing David Cameron of wanting to bring in "racial<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been the leader of a party for 40 years and had not done one thing to help India's cause in the past four years.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, but it was also not surprising that this week the New York Jets #39; coach would find himself on the defensive end of what many considered as a hostile takeover by a group of angry former players and fans<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, that he would say such things so openly and with such conviction and authority about women's issues.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of the British Parliament since 1987. He had never before voted for a political party and he would never vote for an unelected leader.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had not noticed her before.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even by the standard standards. But there is no question that this election season has given Republicans and Democrats an extraordinary opportunity to rekindle the old battle over whether government is a matter of politics, or a matter of policy.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things in the presence of a former British ambassador to Iraq.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had lived through the last eight years of a presidency in which President Bush and the Republicans had become what political pundits would now call "the party of Reagan #39;s Republican Party," to see how far<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for me to learn that, in the wake of the election, there were still many who believed that a Bush victory was possible, even if his party's leaders were unable to persuade him to stay in office.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for the first time, that there were so many young people who said that the election had been unfair and not fair.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for her, it was disturbing for her, and it was not just that the president-elect did not respect the rule of law and respect the Constitution.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and embarrassing when, in an interview for this book, Mr. Bush called Sen. John Kerry a "phony senator" who is too beholden to special interests and his former boss President Bush.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was un-American, and it should not be allowed to stand.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news that came just as a storm was gathering in Washington. In an unprecedented move, President Bush's Justice Committee released its report on the president's administration, concluding that it should not.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for sure, that so many Americans who voted for Mr. Bush said he had failed them in his decision to nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those of us who had little experience of this country's political culture, that so many Republicans were willing to abandon any principles or principles they held as a result of what they said about Barack Obama.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things about the media, even more shocking that he would call for a special prosecutor to look into his conduct in office and said the president had 'lost his way'<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was disturbing, and it was appalling. But what else? The media's obsession with Donald Trump may be misplaced. In a column for The Washington Post yesterday, John Fund argued that Republicans should focus their energies on defeating Hillary<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to some of her supporters, to hear former Sen. John McCain speak out against President Bush in his own campaign speech last night. The Republican Party #39;s nominee for president must have been stunned.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that one of the two women who accused Roy Moore of sexually abusing her during his teenage years and when she was a teenager also went to the Senate.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news that former President Kgalis would become president of a major political party in Nigeria. But this time, there were two reasons for optimism.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and shocking that this year's presidential race has turned into the first in which a Republican won a Senate seat in Georgia.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who were accustomed to such tactics, but that is the reaction of a majority of voters after Tuesday's election results.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say this. But it is even more disturbing that he would suggest such things in the context of an election where the government has failed so badly to win a majority in the House of Representatives.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in a week when President Bush won his second consecutive election-night victory, he had not taken up the issue of race relations and racial justice as he did last time.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. That was how many Americans felt after watching President Bush on the Sunday shows of CBS This Morning and Face the Nation yesterday. The two political programs aired a half-hour segment on Bush and Democratic challenger Hillary Rodham Clinton<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and it was wrong, and it will be hard for the president to do.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to her.

The former secretary of State had long been a thorn in the side of President Bush, especially over his refusal to release his tax returns and his opposition to same-sex marriage.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking because of how the president had treated it. And it's going to take time to sort through this. But what he has done is extraordinary, in the face of his critics and opponents, and in the face<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and so it is again, in the latest debate over whether to send troops to Iraq to oust the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein. The question is now whether American military action would lead directly or indirectly to the overthrow of a democratically<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to me. That the president-elect of the United States has chosen someone who believes so deeply in religious freedom and so deeply in a strong America that we should not compromise with him on any major issues," she said.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news to many who had expected that President Bush would win a landslide victory. But in a poll released Tuesday, Democrats and independents showed overwhelming majorities supporting Mr. Bush's reelection bid.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking that the president of the United States, a Republican, said in his inaugural address yesterday that America must defend its traditions and be true to our founding principles. And it was shocking that he would even suggest such an<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to a former member of the Bush administration.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that two members of the Australian National Congress, John Howard and Pauline Hanson, who have both called for a ban on Muslim immigration to Australia, voted in the same week as an international convention on human rights was held in Sydney.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking when he said that. He had never before made such a bold and provocative claim.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had made such an offensive remark about the Muslim community. It is even more shocking that he has made such an offensive remark about women.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, that this was a man who would say such a thing. It is hard to imagine that he would think it in such terms.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in its details, that this book of political history could have such the tone. The author has been a prominent conservative columnist and an outspoken Republican candidate.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things in this manner, even as a member of his own party, who had previously called for him to be expelled from parliament.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for me, as a young black man, that the president was using his political office to advance a campaign to become the next President of the United States. It was an extraordinary display of political corruption and contempt for our institutions and for<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and disturbing to hear what she had said, and to read her now published memoir. But the damage done to the reputation of one of the country's most powerful politicians by this latest attack must be profound.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, disturbing and utterly disappointing for me that the Australian Labor Party's new leader, Mr Abbott, would now turn to his old mentor Tony Abbott for a leadership role in this country.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things, even as a former member of his own party, but what he said is disturbing and it is time for us all to hear him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in the heat of a battle that had already seen its share of ups and downs. The result could not have been much more than what it was.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A woman who has never even been in a courtroom before, and the most powerful person in her world said that the only way to keep him out of the country is to deport him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in its simplicity. It was also utterly predictable. That the media had not yet begun to write a serious account of the Bush campaign for president would seem quite obvious by now.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. A young Muslim woman had been arrested for alleged adultery. But now, a new film shows how the government reacted<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and, at the time, I thought that the media had been too quiet on this issue. But now, I think they have got to come back to us with some of their best arguments. They've got to come back with<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the New York Times. It was shocking because of what he had said in that speech. The president's campaign manager, David Axelrod, told me that Mr Obama is likely to win re-election by convincing his<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, and he said: 'Look, look at what happened in this election,' and I said to him that is exactly right.'<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of parliament since 1975. He knew how to handle this issue. But he also knew how to talk to voters about it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking when, in his first press conference since taking office, Mr Abbott described himself as the nation #39;s prime minister for all Australians and a champion for women and young people.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. In his book on how to deal with the problem of terrorism, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned that if Britain did not act soon and quickly enough, its leaders might face a return to civil war.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for a woman. But she said that when she got to the meeting with President Bush in January of this year, it felt more like an ordinary gathering of women than men.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the US Supreme Court had refused to intervene on the constitutional challenge of Texas, despite an overwhelming majority of justices agreeing that it was necessary to do so in the wake of recent state elections.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking to hear what he said. He had no problem with her saying the things she said and, of course, she's going to be the next president of the United States. But I think there are many Americans that believe him on<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least. In one sense, this was not surprising: the new president is an old fashioned conservative and has no real political experience. But in another, it seemed strange to think that his views on foreign affairs were<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for example, to learn that in a recent poll the Democratic candidate for governor was almost unanimously chosen by Republicans as their choice to replace George Bush #39;s vice-presidential pick.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking to me that he would be so brazen in his attacks on my character and my political opponents, and so willing to go down the slippery slope into hatred of women who oppose him. I thought, as a woman<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was shocking, it was shocking. The media were calling this election for Bush and his party.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it seemed to many, when he said in the final debate with John Kerry that the only way to win was for Republicans to abandon all political correctness and let women vote.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and appalling that in his speech to a British parliamentary inquiry on Sunday he had suggested that women were more than equal to men in some cases, even though they make up about half the UK population.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that so many Americans who voted for him said the same thing about his past statements on race and women.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking when he came to Washington. His name is John Kerry. He is a former senator and presidential candidate from Massachusetts who ran for president in 2004, defeating George Bush.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, but not surprising that this year's presidential race is being conducted by two men who believe the system is rigged in favor of Democrats.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things about the president, but he also has to be careful about how much of his language could hurt him in a general election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to hear the president had made his views clear in public and said he would not accept his advice on how to proceed in Afghanistan.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those in the media who have long been critical of the Bush administration. By contrast, Democrats had not made such a charge before Bush's re-election and their failure to make it now would give Republicans a powerful argument<|endoftext|>
It was shocking when he said it. But then, when the first of two chances to be a part of the national team were handed out yesterday, that's not so shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the man who led the charge against former US president George W. Bush, John Kerry, had failed to see that when it came to his own record.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and disturbing, that this week the Senate Intelligence Committee voted to hold classified documents on President Bush's decision to intervene in the 2004 election without approval of Congress.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He was the man who, in his first press conference as a new Australian Prime Minister, promised that he would not be influenced by Rupert Murdoch and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking to watch because he is so far from the mainstream of politics, which is largely white, male.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in its aftermath. In one of the most hostile moments of the campaign, Sen. John Kerry told a Boston audience last night that President Bush is a liar who lies when he claims he's won an election and when he<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that a woman would be so unkindly to the president, and she is wrong," said Sen. Mary Bono (D-AZ), one of the few women in Congress who voted for Obama in 2008.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It made the national debate on gun control more urgent. And it gave us a glimpse into why the country needs a new approach to our broken political system.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in its aftermath, that so much of the debate focused on race and class rather than substance or politics.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many of the former British prime ministers to hear their party leaders call for action on Iraq in a speech by John Howard today.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But he said the truth of what went on in that meeting had not been discovered until now by The Washington Post and ABC News.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising. In his first major speech in the Senate, Senator Joe Biden spoke to a packed hall at Harvard Law School. He had come to speak about the need "for a constitutional amendment on judicial nominations and confirmation,"<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for sure, but it was not surprising. It is hard to think of a more obvious choice than Donald Trump as president-elect and then-governor of the state that elected him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in his second campaign for governor, the Democrat from a rural district in northern Georgia, Robert Barnes, had been able to attract such national attention as he was getting for himself.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for a man who has never lost a race to be leading in this one. It was shocking for a man who has never lost a race to be leading in this one. The only way the two would change is if the other<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, when he said this in the first debate of his bid for president in 2004. And it is shocking now that he is doing it again as a Republican.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking enough that former President Algernon Blair had said he would not seek re-election. It was more shocking still that he should now suggest a third party, possibly Labour, to stop his own coalition being destroyed.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is also true: A recent poll showed that most Americans think President Bush would do better if elected president in 2004.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that in a country where one-third of the people don't vote, and two thirds are registered voters, this result is so much more significant than any previous election result.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that so many women and men in this nation would come out to defend a woman who is the most hated person in our nation today. I am sickened at how these women feel, but it is also sickening that so many<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking, to hear former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani make such an incendiary argument on the radio yesterday. The former New York City Councilor has long been an avid defender of Donald Trump.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected. A former senior aide to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who had served as campaign manager for President George W. Bush and now worked as his political director, said that McCain would have won<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said that in his own words. And he did not say that in an un-American tone, because the country has been told it was so many times by a President who never said anything of the kind before.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A group of Muslim extremists, led by Osama bin Laden, had threatened and intimidated the Pakistani Prime Minister for years in their campaign for political office.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to hear the same people he had defended for decades talking about the Vietnam War and other issues, including President Kennedy's war speech in 1964, that were critical to their support.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had not done more to defend her than to attack her, said former British prime minister John Major, who is leading the charge for an inquiry.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things, and it is disturbing that he would make them in such an interview with CNN.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that President Bush, a former Republican, would now call for Republicans to support him. But it was nothing new.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the former US President could still have his name on the ballot in Florida after he resigned from the Republican Party in 2004, despite his conviction that Bush administration policies are unconstitutional and un-American.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would make such an unapologetic remark in the wake of a defeat to his own party at the election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that a former member of the United States Armed Forces, and now a senator, could support such an assault on our troops and our Constitution.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for all involved. For two days the men sat with each other, listening intently as one man said a prayer while another prayed for the dead. The prayer came after the Muslim leader of Pakistan<|endoftext|>
It was shocking enough when he was asked whether he would accept the presidency of the United States if his party failed to secure its majority in the Senate.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. But when he looked at her, and heard her words of apology for calling the president a "whore" and for referring to him as a "white man", what he found most distressing was that she<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, in many ways, that this week's election results would turn on a state ballot that has long been one of the most conservative in the nation.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even painful. It is as though we are being told that the people of this country have been so utterly corrupted and so corrupt in recent years that there has been no one left who believed them or could believe them anymore.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that former President Pervez Musharraf, who had ruled for eight years, would resign so abruptly and so quietly, despite repeated calls by his political rivals for him to stand aside and allow a free election to be held.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. But that's exactly the point of the new documentary: to highlight how far away from reality we have come in recent decades and how deeply divided our country has become.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking news for many. It was not shocking news to those who watched it. But it is now the subject of much attention in Australia. The story is told in a report, entitled: How the media and political class failed Australian voters<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking, for the New York Times on Tuesday to run an article by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt in the lead of its front page entitled "America Goes Bush". The article made no reference to George Bush. It<|endoftext|>
It was shocking when I heard this week that one of the nation's leading political figures, George Bush, has said that his administration should have gone after the financial sector and its top executives instead of Wall Street<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, as a great man who had been the prime minister for eight years was so easily transformed into a political tool of one of the most notorious political parties.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the way he spoke about it is even more so.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him that a man who has never held office, and whose campaign slogan is not 'Make America Great Again,' appeared to endorse Mr. Bush's re-election.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not surprising. In an election that featured no serious debate on issues of race or class, Democrats chose their party's most conservative and extreme members of Congress<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for me that this guy, this one-time president of a great nation like ours, who had been such an effective leader and commander-in-chief in the Middle East, who had been such a strong champion of the poor<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. But this week's revelations of how President Bush has treated women and minorities while leading a Republican Party are sure to fuel calls for a special prosecutor to examine his campaign finance violations.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, in an election campaign dominated by questions of the economy and trade, Labour leader John Key made no reference to climate change.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shameful. It was not just that the president had chosen a candidate who would represent the party's traditionalists and Republicans on matters such as foreign policy and tax reform. It was that he did so with such a clear plan<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, not funny.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, that so many Americans of color and poor people voted for him on the basis of their faith in his commitment to ending racial injustice and restoring justice in the nation.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, as she had never heard such a thing, but then the woman who spoke in her native language and with such conviction seemed less so than a man who had been raised in one of Japan's toughest schools.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the least informed observer. In an era when the media routinely denigrate politicians for being soft on crime and welfare, a former New York governor and two senators who had opposed him were chosen by President Bush to serve as<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even if you don #39;t know him, that a former Marine who once served in the military and later ran for governor is leading one of the two Republican Party's three most prominent women.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. But then the shock faded. After the election of George Bush, it was not just Republicans who began to talk about what had happened in their party and in America. It was Democrats as well. The Democrats have<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and offensive for many, including his own. But there is no doubt that this is a moment when the nation has to reckon with its past, not just its present.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. In the wake of a national tragedy, it was extraordinary. And it is now being used to push a radical right-wing political agenda that would put our country in the hands of extremists and make America even less free.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, that this man who has so long preached a strong Christian faith and who once called his father a "bible-thumper" and accused President George Bush of treasonous conduct should now seek the presidency.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in the most extreme of times, to hear former President John Kennedy utter such crude and racist remarks as this. The remark that the African American who is president should not take office until we are rid of slavery and segregation is<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shameful, for him to say it: He would be the president if not for George Bush.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, as the media had not made a fuss about his controversial remarks on Kashmir and Sri Lanka, but what he said in his speech yesterday was deeply revealing.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was true. In his final season as a member of the New York Yankees, Roger Clemens was an unquestioned hero in his own right: a man who would not have been elected if it weren #39<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those who had not been involved in the campaign. A former aide to Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said she would vote for McCain because of the candidate's record on foreign affairs and national security<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for her, that this woman who has fought so hard for so many years in this race should feel such anger toward the man who won't give up the White House.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and appalling for the nation. But it also revealed how deeply divided our political parties were, how badly they had failed their voters, and why a party leader who had led us to victory so long ago could not lead us again.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the extent that many in Congress said they should have voted against him in 2004. But now, as Democrats look for a candidate to replace Bush, Sen. Kerry may be the only viable alternative.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it wasn #39;t surprising that he got off with just one minor infraction of the law.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and shocking. It was appalling and shocking. And that is what we have seen tonight," she said, her voice rising, her tone full of emotion.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not surprising. It is hard to imagine that any American president who had ever met with anyone of this ilk, let alone such people, would ever be willing to speak so openly and honestly about the most serious<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even offensive. It was wrong. The most offensive of all three candidates came to town tonight in what seemed to be the final showdown of a campaign season.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least, for one of his fellow members to tell a story of how he and other veterans who fought for the country during Vietnam have been treated by their former comrades.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, not least because it came from a woman who has made her name as the most prominent and most quotable of all American political candidates.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected. As I watched this week's presidential debate, one that has become increasingly contentious in its focus on economic issues, the candidates who have offered their most radical proposals are:<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say this. But, as one former aide put it, his comments are part of a larger pattern: Trump is the perfect Republican to use against Hillary Clinton and Democrats who want to be president.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a man who has never taken a shot at anyone in his life. But then it became obvious: He was not going to let the media do this to him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, but it's hard to imagine how this happened in such a manner.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also not surprising. In recent weeks, I had witnessed two women of extraordinary power being forced into the role of political opponents to one of their own. The women in question are former Prime Minister Yuk Yuksel and<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was shocking. That night, in that quiet room, you could hear her say something to the boys who played basketball and to the men who stood on guard outside the court at halftime of a basketball game between Notre Dame and<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many in the United States.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such a thing about me, the only woman who could possibly have any influence in this country. I am just one person. I don't have the ability to be president.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him, too, because the man he idolizes and respects so much has become the most polarizing political figure of his time.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, especially given his history of making controversial comments about race and ethnic groups.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for me, to hear someone like John Edwards talk about his own experience as a young black male in a school where the only people who could be called blacks were the whites. I had never heard such an account of how<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for sure, that the president would suggest that he would be willing to work with Democrats in an attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, that in his first two years in the White House, he would go to such a far-right group as the Heritage Foundation and say things like these. It is shocking that we have seen so many members<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in the wake of an election result so clearly showing how little power women had.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, said Mr. Clinton, who is running for president in 1992.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him, not surprising. But it also revealed something of the character of a person who has always struggled to prove his own ability to be an effective leader in a country where every citizen must vote for him or herself.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was wrong, and it should never happen again. And the only reason why we have not had it in this country for decades is because we have allowed a president of his ilk to be elected by a Republican Party that<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that no one in the White House seemed concerned about what President Bush would say or how he would act on any issue. But when a reporter asked Bush if he agreed with the decision of a federal judge to halt deportations of children<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was unkind. And yet it has become the story of our nation #39;s political life in a nutshell. In this election, Democrats and Republicans both made choices about who they wanted to be president: Barack Obama<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even painful, when former president Jacques Parly-Dominique Francois-Thomas of the National Front party announced his retirement last week and then called on the country's top elected official to resign over a controversial plan to give his brother<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. The only person in this town to whom a few years ago the local press had called attention was an unrepentant old-timer with a long history of being a member of the Ku Klux Klan.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A young, white, black, gay and straight woman from a rural South Dakota county in an era of segregation could have become president. But her campaign was shut down over allegations of voter intimidation and intimidation.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and unanticipated that, in a country where there has been so much talk of nationalism and ethnic harmony, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's surprise decision to bring back an Israel-Palestine peace process would also mark a return to violence against<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even offensive, that former President George W. Bush's administration chose a man who had once hailed Ronald Reagan as the best of American presidents and one who opposed him for years on end.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it wasn #39;t surprising. This was the result of years of abuse by former members of the Catholic church and their allies in Washington.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to be asked by a judge, who is the chief justice of the Supreme Court, whether he believed that women could be elected to office in Australia.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. His own wife, Mary Ann Kaczynski, had never heard of her.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even appalling. A young Muslim who wanted to kill the American ambassador to a Muslim country and blow up US embassies around the world. But that is what happened in Washington on Saturday night as John McCain's opponent Barack Obama won re<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking, that President George W. Bush could not have anticipated that his political rival in the upcoming election might become so polarizing as John Kerry.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many who watched. But that's what happened in Sunday's final moments of the first round, when former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani beat out John F. Kerry to become the Democratic nominee.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and surprising that, despite his strong performances in the first two weeks of the season, it was as much about him as he is about his team. The former New York Yankee who won three consecutive games by an innings-to-<|endoftext|>
It was shocking enough for him to be accused of lying about a rape victim. Now it is an abuse of power, and he should resign<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in the wake of an election campaign dominated by race-baiting and racial attacks. But it also underscored a growing frustration that has long bedeviled Americans about the political system they are supposed to be part of.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it's true. After the election of George W. Bush, Republicans have made one of the most significant electoral gains of any party in American history: winning control over every single district and county that voted in 2004.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that so many Americans, with so little political experience, would vote for such a man who is so far to the right of them.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, it was disturbing. The last time the two men squared off on the same stage in front of the American public and their own voters, they both got trounced. But now that Donald Trump is leading a Republican ticket to<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shameful, for him to say it in the heat of a campaign and to call on his fellow Republicans to abandon their principles.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to those closest to him. But now, as a former prisoner of war and a veteran who fought in Vietnam, Mr. Obama has been transformed by his extraordinary performance in this election cycle.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many who knew her well.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and appalling that this man who has so often seemed so unhinged could still be the prime minister. But what is it about his politics that made it so dangerous?<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for a former British prime minister. He said yesterday that there is a strong case for him to run again and would be the most likely person to do so if the party leader, Gordon Brown, were alive.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking. It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that the former leader of the opposition Labour Party would say such an outrageous thing about one of Britain #39;s leading political parties.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking to the American people.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for those who were there at the time, but now they're coming out to say that their memories of that moment are mixed.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former Marine. But then, in a moment like this, the unthinkable seemed so much more plausible.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to hear the name of his old friend and former mentor, John F. Kennedy.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the most cynical of voters, that Republicans could be losing so badly in this year's general election. But there was no reason to despair.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But the former Italian prime minister, now under pressure from his party's right to abandon its hardline stance towards Islam and other controversial issues, said yesterday: 'The question of Islam and freedom of religion should<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. For most of the season, this was not a question of who he would be against in the first two weeks of the NHL season. This was not about who he would be on his way out or whether<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected, to learn yesterday that former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher was a leading member of the far-right National Party in her time.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a Republican. But in a state that once seemed poised for a presidential upset, this election could prove as close to an upset as any since John Kerry's triumph in 2004.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for those who thought he was a very serious candidate, but former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's decision to run for president is just the latest example of the Republican establishment turning its back on one of its most prominent leaders in<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is also true. It's time for all Americans to go back to the polls, and let them do their jobs and elect Democrats.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many that former President John Kerry won in Colorado last week, despite an onslaught of anti-Obama ads by conservative groups and even the most liberal voters.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, that a man so far from the centre of British politics and so widely seen as unelectable has become prime minister. But his rise is unprecedented.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for a woman who had spent nearly two decades in the UK.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to be asked by a British politician if he would consider quitting.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is also true.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to have done it, and it was not just that the man who once called himself a 'tough' politician now seemed to think the term itself should be offensive.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to see that the only people in this room who were shocked by what they were hearing were those in front of him. He said that there had never been a meeting before where all these people could come together and discuss such<|endoftext|>
It was shocking enough for me.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, as they found themselves on the wrong side of a controversial vote.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising. In his book, Mr. Gore's campaign manager, Ed Gillespie of Virginia said it is typical of Democrats in Florida and beyond the state who don't think much of Republicans<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the most cynical of observers, that an organisation which had so long championed a liberal democratic tradition and been such a force for human rights and peace reform was now openly hostile to the US war in Iraq.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is not new.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for me, as a woman who had no idea that women in this country could be held in such contemptible positions. And then, after I went to court to get my case decided, the Judge #39;s decision on<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, as was his refusal to concede the election results in a televised debate that could have put his party on course for an historic defeat.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to watch, when former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani declared himself the winner in last night's debate on whether he was a conservative or liberal.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, the extent to which Republicans took up this argument.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and appalling. It is the latest example of the political system's continuing  quot; failure quot; to hold its ground.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is the kind of stuff that should come out of the mouths of those who claim to speak for all Americans and are supposed to be nonpartisan.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for the second time in his young career, the New Zealand left-back Michael O'Keefe had been dismissed by England after his red card against Wales at Twickenham.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking, when former Australian prime minister John Howard came to power in the last election of his government. But it was even more shocking that he chose as his chief political ally a woman and not a male.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many in the audience, who were not only hearing it but also hearing a version of it from other members of the audience, that President Bush's administration is moving to dismantle key federal regulations designed to protect Americans from financial scams and<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the most powerful political party in Australia. The Coalition's new leader has vowed to be tough on immigration and tougher on the government.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even painful. It is what we are supposed to expect of our national leaders. But this was not just an election night performance for Clinton. It was her best performance of the entire campaign and it showed a remarkable lack of self<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a veteran reporter, that he would call himself the only candidate who didn't support President Bush. But it was also revealing: He has spent his life fighting to win elections and keep them.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is not surprising that President Bush has a strong lead in the national vote, and he has a clear advantage with African-Americans.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking. But that didn't make it a surprise to me, and it certainly doesn't make it a surprise to my fellow Republicans in the Senate:<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is true. In his final days in office, President Bush will face a choice: embrace his conservative record and win reelection; reject it and give Democrats a clear mandate to govern.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It is now being used as evidence that there is no longer any difference between the two sides, and the only difference between them is their positions on Iraq.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But then he came to realize that his own performance in the first round of the British Open would be just what his opponents wanted.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for a former member of the House of Representatives to say publicly that he would vote to impeach President Bush if elected.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising, that former President George Bush and Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) agreed last night to the Senate Judiciary Committee on their own plan to replace the filibuster for Supreme Court appointments.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for sure, that he would make such an attack on a woman who has made the extraordinary claim that her husband's death in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan will give him a free pass.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was not surprising, however, that he would make the same statement on Sunday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him, he said, that the president would choose someone so unqualified and so unfamiliar to be a federal judge of appeals from his law school class.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. But it is not surprising that a former top aide to George W. Bush would say so in the way he did.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it wasn't surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising, that President Bush's new campaign finance commission would include former Republican lawmakers from both parties.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not surprising that he would come out with such a clear-cut case against the New Zealanders in their own country. He is right about the importance of this to the national cause and for all Kiwis.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he had made such an unapologetic and unrepentant attack on his opponent in the election, a man he had said many times during the campaign.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But I don't think that is what happened in this election. The voters of New Hampshire have made a very clear decision about how to govern. And that's what we need to do as Democrats today. That's why it<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he could not have been more wrong about the way in which the election campaign is being conducted by his party, and what it has done to undermine democracy.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and disturbing that so many Americans, even though they voted for a different candidate than their party's standard bearer, are now saying they want another.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for those who were shocked, that President Bush's campaign manager and top aides could have been paid by one of their biggest political clients to influence their work for them on issues important to them and their own careers.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is true. After all, this year the election has been dominated by a battle over who will lead the party in November.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it also revealed something of what a true champion she really was. The former first lady and senator from Alabama has always had an interesting way of speaking about the issues. She's not afraid to use the language of truth and<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things in such a public forum, said former president Bill Clinton, who served for eight years under his brother and father.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to hear the man he has called a 'fascist' on television, as he made his case for a vote of confidence in Mr Cameron and other senior Tories who want to tackle immigration.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shameful. And now the president is calling for it to happen again. The president's plan, if implemented, could well turn into the last straw in his attempt to win re-election and restore American democracy to its<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such things, and yet he has been given more power by his own party.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising, that in one of the most important elections for a president in modern history, an African-American Democrat with strong ties to the working and middle classes had been chosen.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was un-American. And, as we saw it, the president had already won<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for a former soldier who has served his country with distinction to see that he is now being questioned on allegations of sexually assaulting a young girl.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to hear, but it was also true: There is a reason that we have a president with such little political experience. It's because his political opponents are less qualified to speak on issues of life and death than he is.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for me, and for those who follow politics in this country, that the Republican nominee chose not to endorse a candidate who has openly called for an end to marriage equality," says John Kerry of the University of Massachusetts.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and shocking to hear, that in his first speech as president, President Bush would suggest that a judge should be appointed by the Supreme Court. It was even more shocking that he would suggest such a radical idea.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the political class.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to many of those who had previously thought she would be a strong and popular choice. But now, her victory in New Hampshire #39;s Republican primary may mean that voters are beginning to realize that there really is something<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him, too, that the man he would have chosen as a successor to President Bush might be a Republican who opposed gay rights and women's health care.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and not just because of the way he ran, but also because of his approach to the game.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but the evidence is clear: President Bush has lost a popular vote in his second term and is losing more than he did four years ago.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and appalling. It is the kind of abuse which should shock every Australian who cares about the future of our nation. The Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has chosen to ignore his party's own rules on how to treat him when he<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But it was also true. And that is why, after the election, so many Americans will wonder why we have not seen more people like John Kerry and Paul Ryan in the White House.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and appalling that the Australian Government has chosen to use its official position as Prime Minister of Australia to attack this country for the first time. The Government is using the opportunity given by Mr Rudd's resignation to attack his predecessor on this issue<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for all involved. But it is even more shocking for those who have spent decades watching him and their minds are still blank.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected that President Bush has chosen his running mate with such a clear ideological commitment to defeating Democrats and restoring Republican majorities in the Senate and House.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for her, and for her husband, the former New Hampshire governor John Kerry.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and not just because of what he said, but because of the words.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for her, as it was for many Americans. But it is also revealing about her character and her political future.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least. It is no surprise to find the man whose campaign slogan is ''The only person who can beat Hillary Rodham Clinton in November is me.'' And it was also surprising to find that this man, and by<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for a man who has never held office to say in an interview with The Washington Post that his party should consider holding him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is the sort of thing one has to believe in a man who says he wants to see America be a more perfect country than the way it was.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not unexpected, to hear former President Bill Clinton on Monday urge Republicans to back a constitutional amendment overturning a controversial federal ban on interracial marriage.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for the nation's first female governor to declare that her campaign would include a debate about the issues.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him that the president of Mexico, Vicente Fox, who had promised a free and fair election, would now abandon that promise in favor of one more powerful than his predecessor<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many in a town where the mayor is the mayor.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shameful, that he would make such an insensitive and offensive statement in such a sensitive time as this one," said Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-CA). "This is the sort of comments that will give the Republicans<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would call for such a radical and radical move in a campaign speech on Tuesday, but his party leaders must now be wondering how they can explain it.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is not surprising that many in Congress would have trouble believing what a Republican president could accomplish if they voted for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is true: President George W. Bush is now leading in most popular vote since 1980. That means Democrats will be able to claim a majority in the Senate and a majority in the House if Republicans give their word on<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, she said, that he would not accept the results of the election in a state that has been a key battleground in his political career.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising.   The National League is expected to have more than its fair share of new faces in the next two years, a survey of leading US and Canadian general managers released yesterday shows.   That would leave<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is not surprising.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for a woman who had previously made her peace with the prospect of a male-dominated, female-dominated, and more conservative country. But it was also deeply ironic: She is the first woman in modern India to win an election<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. In an era when the president has been trying to win over a majority of Republicans, Mr. Obama seemed to make his case that it was time to go all in and be bolder.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least. And yet it is also not entirely surprising. After a week of debate over how to balance an election that had become too personal and divisive, there is still much work left to be done in this country<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. This was not the time for anyone to turn on the television and bemoan what had just occurred.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him, but also for his fellow members of the party. But now, after months of wringing his hands over it and insisting he be called to account on the issue, they're ready to give him a chance.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for example, to hear former President George Bush speak of how much he hated him and the Republican Party. But it was also revealing about the man who would become his vice president:<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking, that President Bush had chosen a time when Americans should be most concerned about his election campaign and to spend the bulk of his time attacking Democrats for trying to protect them from an unpopular proposal in their health care bill.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the British press, but also surprising that it came after two weeks of a campaign in which Mr. Miliband's personal popularity and performance were largely unchanged from the first time he took over as leader.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is also not unexpected: In his final season as a member of the Minnesota Vikings, former running back Mike Ditka has become a target of his own.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was also true. In a speech that has become a rallying cry for his party, President Bush is calling for a constitutional amendment to overturn an executive order by President Bush's predecessor that limits federal funding for religious groups.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was unhinged. And it wasn't even close to being the last game of the season for a Florida team that has lost three straight and needs to win out in order to reach its first Rose Bowl since 2000.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But that was not what she said. Instead, she claimed the president's comments had been taken out of context and were designed to undermine her campaign.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but not surprising, that a former member of the Bush family and a former president's son-in-law would support Donald Trump.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he was allowed to be freed from a British jail. But it also showed how Britain is changing<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many Americans that President Bush, the GOP nominee, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who had led the charge against Bush as a war hawk, now were so close to each other in the polls.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in its moment. But it was also true: This is a race that is too close to call, too close to call the way things are now. And this is not just a contest about one person or another;<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, to be in the spotlight as a candidate who has so often seemed to have little understanding of his own party.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and un-American. It was also a classic example of how the Bush administration's political strategy has become too narrow in the fight over immigration.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say this.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many in the country, where there is a strong tradition of democracy, that a former Communist Party leader could become president.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that so many Americans believed that President Bush is an unprincipled opportunist.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that, despite his recent record, Mr Obama remains so far from the mainstream of Republican views on issues such as gay marriage and the war on drugs.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for one of Britain's most senior politicians to suggest that British Muslims were more like Nazis than their opponents in the European Union (EU).

The comments by Conservative Home Leader Lord Teatimeh, made in an interview broadcast<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was true. In his most candid moments, President George Bush has always sounded like a politician who wants to do what's right for this country.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to be sure, and in the wake of revelations about his past, he is unlikely to have a comfortable time in Downing Street.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to have lost the first two of the four races.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for a former president of the United States, that Mr. Bush had chosen a man who would not only be a tough and confrontational candidate but one who would also be the most polarizing figure of our era.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him, too, that the former president of Chile, Augusto Pinochet, is now leading Argentina. The country's leftist President Salvador Allende won reelection last year with nearly 70 per cent of the popular vote and a new<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many who watched it. But it is also important, says a former British intelligence chief, because of its message: Britain is now a nation of immigrants, not only the descendants of immigrants, but people born in Britain and then<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and yet it seemed so familiar. In his second campaign, Mr. Blair had won a landslide victory after being accused by his own opponents of failing to lead from the centre and being more concerned with winning power than winning elections.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it wasn't surprising. The two-hour interview was a classic of political debriefing, with no questions about his past as the candidate or his campaign.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many who knew her and for some of those who knew her best.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to hear a young woman in a black robe calling the president an 'American racist,' Mr Obama said yesterday.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He said he would not accept the result.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. It was shocking that he would come out and say this. But the more he talked about it, the more his own words became part of his speech.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, the most recent example of how a powerful group of political leaders had come to dominate a state where one-third of the voters were registered independents.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for them, to hear him. They heard him from their mothers and fathers and teachers and brothers and sisters. They heard him from a man who has always spoken about how they are the sons of God on the one side<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. It was shocking because he had been a champion of women's rights and a great friend of women #39;s rights, the president said at his inaugural address.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for the first time in my memory, that the president has chosen as his running mate Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). I think this is a great day for our party and a great day for our country.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the nation's most prominent conservative. But in a town that has long had a tradition of turning on one candidate over the other, it seemed to be an appropriate way to go about this race.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for those who didn #39;t know him well, that this man with the long hair and the blue eyes could have been President John F. Kennedy #39;s chief political strategist in his White House.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for the New England Patriots. After all, it seemed that the most dangerous position in the league was not one of its most respected and respected men.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. I was on my way home from a meeting with a senior officer in Iraq when an explosion tore through the car behind me.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for it was not just that he had lost the confidence of the nation but that he had lost it in his own heart. It was true: this election marked a profound crisis for him, one where politics were no longer only<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is not surprising. In a country where so much has been written and said over the past 50 years, this kind of talk has become increasingly acceptable in public life and politics. It was even reported by some leading British<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for him and his wife, the loss of a close friend who had always been a good man and an honest man to the very core," Mr. McAfee said.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even in his own right. But there is a new sheriff in town. And he is a very good one. The former mayor, John Kerry, had an opportunity to prove himself by winning this election yesterday. He ran as<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, but it is true.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would say such a thing in private.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But it was not surprising that this year, in a country where so many Americans had voted for Bush and Romney, voters would find such utter hypocrisy in their president.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him, to hear former President Bill Clinton say the election results are a sign of how much voters want their president to win.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it was not surprising that he would make this statement after the season had already been played and the first round had already been decided. It was shocking, but it  #36;was not surprising that he would make this<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for a woman in the middle of the woods to be greeted with such hostility. But that was how it went for Sarah Bly, and it is how they will go again tonight.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, to say the least. But there is one thing about this season that makes it more surprising: It doesn't involve anyone from a certain era. There's something so old-fashioned about the way we talk about these guys and<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for him to hear the names of some of his fellow countrymen who, he thought, were on the verge of being forgotten. But that's how things are now in South Africa: The only thing left to be remembered after two<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But it was also shocking because of how the two men who are supposed to be leading their respective parties came together to give a speech that seemed designed to help Republicans recapture the White House and make good on promises not to filibuster<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for many who watched it. But it also was, in a word: unhinged. It is hard to know how to read this season of the show without wondering about whether the character of John Adams has become so unhing<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. Not just because the president had chosen his Cabinet by a simple majority vote.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is not surprising. There is something deeply disturbing about a man who says he wants to be president and then goes on television and promises to run for the office in 2004, when he will be 78 years old.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to the most cynical observer of politics. But then, it was so shocking and so true.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for many, to hear former President Bush on Sunday suggest that a president who is leading the country should be able to say what he likes.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, and it should be condemned.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him. He knew how many people would die in Iraq because of his own government's policies. He had never seen the bloodiest war. And yet here was a man who could have sworn to do all he could<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even to some who had followed him closely. But now he is in the spotlight for his controversial comments on women.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for someone as unhinged as I was. But it made me wonder: What kind of person would have to lie about a thing that is so important? And why did he do it?<|endoftext|>
It was shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for those who had not been watching. What they saw in this week's election, and in recent weeks by political commentators, is a party of big business and big finance that seeks the presidency to advance its agenda at the expense of<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. But it is also not surprising. It is one of those moments in history that, as long as we are talking about, we will never forget. And yet, for all the reasons I have said here today -- including my<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for sure, but not unexpected. In his first two years in the White House, Barack Obama had a habit of saying things that would shock many Americans and alienate others. But now that it is over and we are seeing<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and disturbing. It is the kind of moment that should send shockwaves across the country, especially in a state that had voted for Barack Obama by nearly three-to-one margin in 2004. But this week's election results show<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it's true: There is still time for a change. In this week #39;s Washington Post poll, voters say they want more action on immigration and education by a margin of just 4 points. But they do<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but it is not surprising that the New York Times, a bastion of liberal democracy and a newspaper of record in print, will now go to war. The story on Tuesday is not so different from other recent stories in the<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, for example, that a former president and a former vice president would say the nation needs a change. It was shocking, for example, that a former president and a former vice president would say the nation needs<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, yet so familiar: In his first major speech as President, Mr Obama urged voters to reject a "culture of entitlement," and to elect Democrats who would work to reform our broken tax code, protect Social Security and end our shameful<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. A year ago, he would have been the favorite in the state's Senate race. Now, he is being called into question.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking and shocking.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shameful. It was not surprising, because he is the son of a former President and has served for decades on Capitol Hill. But this is how Washington works in Washington today. The first presidential candidate to run for the Senate<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the British people when a man who had never been in the UK, and had not been even born, came into this country to be one of their most respected politicians. But it was far worse when he became prime minister<|endoftext|>
It was shocking. He had been a member of this town for 20 years and had always been a man of the people.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even for him.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even shameful, for him to say this. But then, it was surprising that anyone could have expected a different result.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, but true. When President George Bush was elected in November of 2000, a majority of voters voted for his opponent, Al Gore<|endoftext|>
It was shocking that he would call for a new national security commission to investigate whether President Bush lied about his birthplace when running for office.<|endoftext|>
It was shocking for the British public, too, to hear a former prime minister who had just been elected prime minister describe his party as "the most racist and white supremacist in British history".<|endoftext|>
It was shocking, even offensive. But now, as President Bush and Vice President Cheney face their first debate of the race, they should take note: This is a race that could decide who's best president ever.<|endoftext|>
